A better job today&#8230; I had a chantico but the rest of the day was pretty darned good (well, there were a couple of cookies but overall a very decent day, probably under 1500 calories with lots of fiber and protein).
  
I decided that if I&#8217;m going to run in some races I should probably get started pretty soon now on the actual running thing. Running&#8230; that sounds familiar. I wonder if I might possibly have a book or two on running in my office&#8230;

Ah yes, there they are. Thumbed through and found the best &#8216;getting back on the horse&#8217; program for myself and ran today. It felt really good and I definitely burned off that Chantico. Ended up going 2.75 miles with the warmup/cooldown so I&#8217;m feeling good about my goals for this whole racing thing.
