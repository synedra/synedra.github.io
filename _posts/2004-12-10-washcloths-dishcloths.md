The day I decided to start knitting (because my visiting [friend](http://fickleknitterfiend.blogspot.com) was so enthusiastic) we went to one of the LYS&#8217;s around here, [The Golden Fleece](http://thegoldenfleece.com). It&#8217;s a pretty nice place, but they&#8217;re remodeling and their book section was a little parched. I bought some nifty cotton yarn and 3 books there, including one called &#8220;10, 20, 30 minutes to Knit.&#8221; This innocuous little book seemed, to my untrained eye, pretty cool, and it had a couple of washcloth patterns which sounded rather doable. So off I went to learn to knit and purl to get ready for my Dishcloth Debut.
  
Then I started actually trying to knit one of their dishcloth patterns and I would probably have stopped knitting forever if I were less stubborn &#8211; what a crappy pattern. 18 different rows (there were diagonal bumpy parts) so it was really hard to get into any sort of rhythm. Yuck. So I decided the book was lame but remained somewhat intrigued by the washcloth idea and committed to knitting stuff.
  
When I was at my fairly fabulous other LYS ([The Yarn Place](http://www.theyarnplace.com)) the other day, I mentioned that I had been working on a washcloth to practice my stitches, and she said &#8220;That&#8217;s what God made washcloths for!&#8221; Which hadn&#8217;t occurred to me, but it made perfect sense. Who cares if your stitches are completely even if they&#8217;re going to be scrubbing pans or wiping hands. What a fabulous notion!
  
My washcloth plan was reignited, and I went web-hunting for dishcloth patterns. Sure. Dishcloth patterns. Who would create a site for something so mundane? But there&#8217;s a place for everything on the internet&#8230; [The Dishcloth Boutique](http://www.jimsyldesign.com/~dishbout/kpatterns/knitting.html). It&#8217;s actually really cool! With excellent java navigation allowing you to quickly browse the choices. I&#8217;ve got tons of cotton yarn to work with so my stitches should be beautiful in no time and I&#8217;ll have some fabulously fun looking dish/wash cloths for my guests to admire.
  
But right now I really need to finish up that Irish Hiking Scarf and then the funky hat I&#8217;m planning, and then, and then&#8230; well, who needs sleep. Enough messing with my blog template, back to some actual work coding, then I have to prepare for the Girl Scout meeting, and then maybe tonight I&#8217;ll get to knit some more.
