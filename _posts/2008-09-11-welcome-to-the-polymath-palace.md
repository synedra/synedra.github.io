For all of you who have been beamed over to here from the PerlGoddess website, a little explanation is probably in order. Before I started working at my [current company](http://www.ami.com/), building applications involving graph databases and [freebase](http://www.freebase.com/), I used to do all of my coding in Perl. Alas, this is no longer the case. In fact, since I started here I believe the only thing I&#8217;ve done with my Perl skills is some minor hackery on our Socialtext installation. And since I&#8217;m an OCD person, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m not able to convince myself that it&#8217;s ok to post about anything non-perl related on a PerlGoddess website. And so my blog has sat unloved and unposted upon for months, due to this somewhat bizarre neurosis.

When deciding what to name my new site, I tried hard to think of something that wouldn&#8217;t paint me into a corner. Domestigirl was nice (until someone squatted on it), but kind of fenced me into cooking and knitting and the like, and it suffered a similar fate, although not as abruptly. PerlGoddess never really made it into &#8220;regular blogging&#8221; territory for the reasons mentioned above. The topics I might be motivated to post about are wide-ranging indeed &#8211; from martial arts to Adobe Flex to semantic web ideas to philosophy to singing (and let&#8217;s don&#8217;t forget cooking)&#8230; anyhow, you get the drift. I&#8217;ve got a lot going on and I&#8217;m frequently switching hobbies. 

So, welcome to the Palace of Princess Polymath &#8211; blogging by a flibbertijibit (and sometimes, her clone). I promise that I&#8217;ll try to use real words in describing whatever&#8217;s flitting through my brain, and hope that the posts end up being amusing to someone (at least myself!)
  
Coming soon, in no particular order: 

  1. Ode to a Kindle
  2. Singing samples so I can join a band
  3. A review of the fabulous math site Aleks
  4. A discussion of maths large and small
  5. Some commentary on a scrabble game or New York Times crossword

&#8230; or perhaps something completely different. One just never knows.
  
Anyhow, welcome.
