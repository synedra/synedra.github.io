I&#8217;ve submitted my [talk proposals](http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/14/0049217&from=rss) for the [Pittsburgh Perl Workshop](http://pghpw.org/ppw2007/), which I&#8217;ll be attending as a volunteer to give [Casey](http://blog.caseywest.com/) a hand. I submitted the Hydra talk I had so much luck with at OSCON, and also a talk on Metaweb.

<!--more-->


  
Since I&#8217;m in the no-man&#8217;s land of &#8220;Already gave notice but haven&#8217;t changed jobs yet&#8221; I&#8217;ve got some time on my hands to consider various things in a philosophical way. I spent a little time contemplating the synergy between the two talks.
  
Hydra is a system for presenting wiki data in a non-wiki way using the fairly fabulous Socialtext API. In that talk, I discuss the basic data structure of wiki pages and the wonders of our Rest API, including the query structure and how to manipulate the results to present the information differently. I also cover Blikistan, a perl-built framework which allows you to build different wiki views more easily, and then I demonstrate a couple of example sites built using these tools.
  
Metaweb is a semantic database framework, which has been used to power Freebase (and my new gig is going to involve writing applications using Metaweb as a back end). In this talk, I&#8217;ll discuss the structure of the data in Freebase, and the wonders of the Metaweb Query Language. I&#8217;ll discuss how the result structure allows you to manipulate the results to meet your needs. And then I&#8217;ll talk about the perl library for accessing Metaweb and manipulating the results, and show an example application.
  
So, one talk about the company I&#8217;m leaving, one about my new company. Both talks discuss using an API to present information in a different way, and both discuss a data model being used in a different way than its base use. And I end up both talks with discussions of a perl library and a demonstration of its work. I hope this doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m boring.
  
I&#8217;m happy to spend the time talking about Socialtext, even though I&#8217;m leaving. I believe strongly in the company and the technology, and I love many things about the code &#8211; and I&#8217;ve spent so long helping to build up a developer community that it would seem odd \*not\* to keep on doing that. With Metaweb, it&#8217;s a new and shiny thing, full of amazing and interesting potential, and I can&#8217;t wait to show it to people and encourage them to think about what they can do with it.
  
So, apparently my interests lie in &#8220;Moving stuff from here to there&#8221; whatever I&#8217;m doing, but I&#8217;ve noticed that this is actually quite a common thread. I&#8217;m excited about talking to (and with) the folks at PPW and getting new ideas about both products.
