After I got my new sidebar widget working, I thought I&#8217;d go and see if any more of my friends were listed on Twitter, and discovered to my chagrin that they have elected to remove the &#8220;search for people&#8221; function on Twitter.  It&#8217;s been replaced by an &#8220;Allow Twitter to Rifle Your Rolodex&#8221; function where it looks to see if anyone you know is on twitter &#8211; and then does the super annoying Facebook-like list of everyone who isn&#8217;t enTwittered yet &#8211; &#8220;These losers haven&#8217;t signed up yet.  Spam them for us!&#8221;  Yeah, no.

  Two third party folks have made cool applications to replace this functionality.  Neither is perfect (and they&#8217;re both pretty overwhelmed), but they&#8217;re better than nothing.  You can find people with the name of <whatever> at <a href="http://www.twitterdir.com">twitterdir</a>, and you can find friends-of-friends at <a href="http://crazybob.org/twubble/">twubble</a>.  I had a lot of fun futzing with the latter this morning.

  Your other alternative is to google &#8220;site:twitter.com Kirsten Jones&#8221;

  Note that if you play with twubble for too long, Twitter will throttle you, and you&#8217;ll end up with no functionality for your cool sidebar widget thing for an hour while you contemplate the error of your ways.
