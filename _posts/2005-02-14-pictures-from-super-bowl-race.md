The pictures are finally up from the Santa Cruz Super Bowl 3k. As it turns out (from the results) I actually ran 12:47 miles which surpasses my expectations (it helps if you keep your expectations low, I suppose).
  
Anyhow, without further ado, I present pictures from the race&#8230;

I&#8217;ve been doing well with martial arts, but won&#8217;t have a class tomorrow so I&#8217;ll use that day for a running workout (woo!). Looking forward to it. I sure wish the Ipod shuffle wasn&#8217;t sold out everywhere. I reallyreallyreally want one!
  
I remember now that I promised measurements. I&#8217;ll get those up tomorrow.
