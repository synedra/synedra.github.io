Thank God it&#8217;s Monday, so I can get back to work and rest up from my frantic weekend&#8230; a Girl Scout, knitting, chores, jiu jitsu and shopping extravaganza. Thanks for all the healing vibes for my sick kitty, he&#8217;s doing much better. My other cat is a little miffed that he hasn&#8217;t gotten any photo credits yet, so I present for you&#8230; Talon!

Any thoughts on why we might not pose this mature 12-year old cat casually with my knitting?

Anyone?

Or why we might have named him &#8220;Talon&#8221;?

Well anyways, he&#8217;s a handsome fellow and worthy of a yarn sacrifice now and then.
  
In other news, I have successfully assimilated one of my best friends into the knitting borg. My newly-assimilated friend and I went to get some needles from my LYS but their stock is still wiped out from the holidays, so I planned my weekend around trying to get over to [Knitting Arts](http://www.goknit.com) for their post-holiday sale &#8211; I need to do some sock knitting for the newbie [Sockapalooza swap](http://www.christinesflowers.com/blog/) so I needed DPNS, and she just wanted some needles and yarn to start with so she didn&#8217;t have to keep borrowing.
  
I almost didn&#8217;t make it. They close at 5 on Sundays and our chores took us to 4:30 &#8211; considering that it was raining and the place is 1/2 hour away I was willing to give up, but my gallant husband shepherded the kids into the car and we headed over to the store &#8211; we called ahead to tell them I might be a bit late. As it turns out, it was a good thing. There were still 10 shoppers frantically trying to scoop up armfuls of sale-priced treasures when I got there at 5:05, so the weary clerks tried to fend me off until I said that I was the person who had called ahead, at which point they waved me in. I didn&#8217;t feel too bad &#8211; there were still 3 shoppers left in the store when I left 10 minutes later. Sadly, the books I wanted to get had already been sold but I got my friend some starter needles and snagged some very sexy DPNs at 20% off&#8230;

&#8230; so I can get started on some socks once I&#8217;m done with the Almost Comleted Irish Hiking Scarf. I&#8217;ll use the leftover red felted merino yarn &#8211; perhaps some nice wool socks will help redeem me for my previous novelty yarn use in the eyes of these Serious Knitters:

Or perhaps not. I might buy some fun fur for my daughter to use as fringe on her latest scarf, so I&#8217;m probably bound for the special hell for novelty yarn knitters. It&#8217;s ok, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be in [good company!](http://grnydgrl.typepad.com/greeneyed_grrl/)
