Man, it&#8217;s been a week since I updated my site. I feel like such a flake. My friend is still in the ICU at Stanford, and I got a chance to visit her yesterday. It was really nice to be able to see her and talk to her&#8230; I felt better having visited. I&#8217;ve been responsible for all the [updates](http://susanupdates.domestigirl.com) to her many supporters and it&#8217;s been a very hard week. I had a cold early in the week so couldn&#8217;t work out or visit my friend until yesterday&#8230; ugh. Not a good week.
  
On the plus side, I finished Sherbet:

Sherbet is the &#8220;Paula&#8217;s Perfect Project&#8221; pattern from The Yarn Girls&#8217; Guide to Kid Knits. I used Tahki Chat, carried double to get the gauge and warmth I wanted. I learned a lot of new skills on this project &#8211; there is no single piece I did fewer than 2 times. But I&#8217;m very happy with it, it&#8217;s super cute and it will look adorable on Kaily. It was a fast knit even with my obsessive frogging, all done on 13&#8217;s and 11&#8217;s. One reason I like the book so much is that it uses &#8216;real&#8217; yarn instead of tiny fingering baby yarn. And still the sweater is nice looking and I think it will work out great.
  
In fitness news, oday I ran in a [3K race](http://fitness.domestigirl.com/) to kick off my racing season &#8211; it was very fun and I felt great &#8211; then came home to our super bowl party and had a bunch of yummy junk to eat. Just generally a good day all around. Even my previously sick kitty was in a good enough mood to play in his cat tree&#8230; I think the insulin dose we&#8217;re using is just right for him, finally.

That&#8217;s my Boy peeking around from behind the tree &#8211; Stormy usually doesn&#8217;t want to play with him but today he thought it was fun.
