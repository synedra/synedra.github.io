First, let me give a huge thanks to Elizabeth of [Three Olive Martini](http://threeolivemartini.blogspot.com/) for her donation \*and\* for the wonderful shout out on her blog!
  
OK, for all of you out there who are not fiber nuts, but in need of some enticement, I&#8217;m going to throw out a few other options for you to ponder&#8230;
  
As you may know, I live in Santa Cruz, California. Santa Cruz has tons of cool stuff (not just beaches and surfers!)
  
Love Sweets? Santa Cruz has 3 independent candy makers and the best cookie company on the planet:
  
[Donnelly&#8217;s Chocolates](http://www.donnellychocolates.com)

This place is amazing. Read one blogger&#8217;s [review](http://bccy.blogspot.com/2002/05/once-long-ago-i-got-my-hands-on-single.html) (and another [here](http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/05.26.04/dining-0422.html). Now wipe the drool off your chin and click that sponsor link!
  
[Marini&#8217;s Candies](http://www.mariniscandies.com/)

Marini&#8217;s has more of your normal candy options &#8211; they&#8217;re mostly famous for their salt water taffy in a zillion flavors.
  
<a href="http://www.mackenzies-chocolates.com/>MacKenzie&#8217;s Chocolates</a>

MacKenzie&#8217;s also makes lots of yummy chocolate options &#8211; more sedate than Donnelly&#8217;s but more gourmet than Marini&#8217;s.
  
[Pacific Cookie Company](http://www.pacificcookie.com/)

You&#8217;ll just have to trust me on this one. These are the best cookies ever. Especially the peanut butter chocolate chip.
  
If you&#8217;re a winner, just say the word and I&#8217;ll go fetch something from one of these fine establishments for you as your Sweet Prize.
  
Not a fan of sweets \*or\* fiber? What&#8217;s wrong with you? OK, I have something for regular folks too. For a Thrilling Prize, I&#8217;ll give 2 tickets to the [Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk](http://www.beachboardwalk.com/). I know this isn&#8217;t too useful if you don&#8217;t live around here but I&#8217;m guessing you won&#8217;t pick this one if you live in Alaska. Or Florida. However, I know I have lots of San Francisco Bay Area readers and this prize is worth about $60, so I figured I&#8217;d offer it as an option.
  
Don&#8217;t worry, tomorrow I&#8217;ll get back to the fiber enticements&#8230; candy porn is somehow not as satisfying as fiber porn. But if any of the above is tempting, then [sponsor me](https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/la/secure/myWebPage.cfm?pID=232938) ðŸ™‚
