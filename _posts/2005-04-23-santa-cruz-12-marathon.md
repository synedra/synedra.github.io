Well, it was called the half marathon but I only did the 10K course. Still, I managed 13:58 miles which I&#8217;m very happy about! We did 15&#8217;s on the way out (until the turnaround) so we must have done 13&#8217;s on the way back, very nice! After running this race in shoes one size too large I went over to [Running Revolution](http://www.runningrevolution.com) and they video taped me running on the treadmill until we found some perfect shoes for me &#8211; new Asics, very comfy!
  
And there are PICTURES! Actually I also got my pics back from the SF run as well but I need to scan one in&#8230; but here are the pictures from the Santa Cruz race:

Me! At the finish line but still smiling. That guy blazing along behind me was doing the 1/2 marathon, so he did his race twice as fast as I did mine. Someday I hope to be fast enough not to be lapped by anyone. Gotta keep those goals attainable ðŸ™‚

Amy and myself about a mile from the finish. I told her &#8216;look happy!&#8217; hence her somewhat incredulous expression.
