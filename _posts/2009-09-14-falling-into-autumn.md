I&#8217;ve started a new job at [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com) (hurray!), making sure that our partner branded apps get certified quickly and effectively, and ensuring that our API meets their needs. It&#8217;s a great job, and I&#8217;m having a wonderful time. Netflix is exactly the kind of company I want to work for. You might have noticed, my imaginary computer friends, that I haven&#8217;t been blogging, but this is just because all the synapses in my brain have been occupied with the effort of ramping up on my new job. I&#8217;m no longer a telecommuter, but I do have a &#8220;corner office&#8221; with a &#8220;window&#8221; so that&#8217;s pretty excellent.

I&#8217;ve been scrambling recently with my &#8220;real life&#8221; and I realized that September is always like this &#8211; back to school this, boy scout that, prepare for holiday the other thing, just generally full of events. Having started back to martial arts (at [Elite](http://www.438kick.com) in Scotts Valley) even my unscheduled evenings are scheduled. 

So, let&#8217;s see what this week looks like. Today my lunch hour will be spent at the Federal Building in San Jose with the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Trustee. Tonight is unscheduled, so I will head home, make some dinner, eat said dinner, go to martial arts, and then help the Boy with his homework. Then maybe we&#8217;ll have time to play a game or watch a movie.

Tomorrow is work-from-home day, which is great because it means I can take the Boy both to the Dentist and to the Doctor while getting my work done. Then he has Boy Scouts. And I may go to martial arts.

Wednesday looks like today. Thursday night Victoria and I are headed to a friend&#8217;s house to do henna. Friday I&#8217;ve scheduled and need to run her menarche ritual. Thankfully I&#8217;ve already bought all the things I need for that, although I still need to print out all the parts and gather together the pieces. And order a cake.

During the weekends I tend to feel guilty if I don&#8217;t &#8220;do things&#8221;, but perhaps I need to do a better job of reminding myself that a day of rest is not just for world-builders. Hanging out with my family is valuable, and models sane behavior. We all need to reset our brains and spirits or we run the risk of forgetting why we&#8217;re doing the things we&#8217;re doing.
