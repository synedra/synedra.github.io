Short run yesterday &#8211; ran 2 miles on the treadmill and discovered that at 4.5 mph my legs get tired before my heart rate goes above 165. This is very cool, because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been looking for. No, 4.5 mph is not very fast. But now I can start really training my \*legs\* instead of having my workout completely driven by heartrate. A very nice thing indeed!
  
Martial arts tonight, no running to speak of.
  
Measurements! I promised measurements. I have updated them in my sidebar (start/current). My waist has not shrunk, darnit. But my hips, which were annoying me greatly, have. And my arm is a bit more dainty, that&#8217;s kinda nice. And I lost 5.5 pounds during the month which is also pretty groovy.
  
Tomorrow my hair will go from the wacky mess you see in the pictures on the previous entry to a smooth and flat wonderland. Can&#8217;t wait!
