And now for something completely different&#8230; I know you&#8217;re all waiting on pins and needles to see the finished sockapalooza sock but it&#8217;s not done yet, so I thought I&#8217;d do a commercial break for my mom. She&#8217;s a fabulous artist who has a piece in the Healdsburg &#8220;Sitting Pretty&#8221; fundraiser/auction tomorrow night, so if you&#8217;re in the North Bay you might run by the [Plaza Arts Center](http://www.plazaartscenter.org) and take a look at her cool chair. The fundraiser provides money for the center, which provides classes and local school art programs.
  
Her description: The design is inspired by Gustav Klimt, specifically his painting, Three Phases (Faces?) of Woman. I only included two of the faces &#8211; the other was an old crone. He does a lot of decorative gold leaf, which I tried on the hair, quilt and the patterns on the back.
  
Here&#8217;s some photos&#8230;
