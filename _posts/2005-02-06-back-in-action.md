It&#8217;s been awfully hard getting back on the horse this week. My friend is still in the hospital, and I had an annoying cold. Wednesday I made it to martial arts, but I was much worse on Thursday so I took a few days off and then today I did the Santa Cruz Super Bowl 3K (I know, 3K, woo, but it was fun). I walked/ran and did it in 23:30, so about 13 minute miles. It&#8217;s a start, I&#8217;m proud to have gotten out there.
  
My kids did the kids 1k and got ribbons:

My mom did the 3k with me (I don&#8217;t have a pic of me running yet):

All in all, a fun race. The next race I&#8217;m planning is a 12K across the Golden Gate bridge on 3/20 so I&#8217;d better get cracking on the training!
