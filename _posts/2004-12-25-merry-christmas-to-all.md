Remember how I thought I might work on the scarf yesterday? Hah. I forgot about my plans for massive cooking, and the poor scarf sat untended. I made a kabocha pie and some more sweet potato bread pudding, and we chowed on ham and other yummy stuff. I didn&#8217;t manage to finish the peanut butter balls but I can make those today (they simply require dipping in chocolate). After dinner, there was a massive present opening frenzy, and the kids seemed happy with their hauls. I&#8217;m certainly happy with my haul, including an ice cream maker and some gorgeous earrings.
  
This morning the kids were kind enough to sleep in until \*7\* AM (I remember getting up at
  
4:30 when I was a kid) so I&#8217;m relatively awake. They loved their presents, the Wellington in the oven, kids playing a video game&#8230; I can \*finally\* sit down and work on the Irish Hiking Scarf. I am so ready for some knitting time.
  
Wishing everyone out there the merriest of holidays.
