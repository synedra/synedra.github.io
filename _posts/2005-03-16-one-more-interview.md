Yes, that&#8217;s right, ladies and gentlemen, one more post on the fascinating topic of \*ME\* ðŸ™‚
  
[Suzie](http://purlygates.blogspot.com/) snuck in with one more set of questions for me to answer&#8230;
  
<font color=blue>1. What type of buddhist training would you like to do? (Zen? Vipassana? Other?)</font>
  
Living as I do in the Santa Cruz mountains, very near to [The Land of Medicine Buddha](http://www.medicinebuddha.org/), I&#8217;d mostly likely go the Tibetan Buddhist route. My kids even went to summer school there one year, which was pretty cool. It&#8217;s very peaceful and calm up there.
  
<font color=blue>2. What is your favorite thing about living on the coast? </font>
  
I love being able to go down to the beach, just watch the waves, smell the sea air, and feel the breeze off the water. I&#8217;ve pretty much always lived on the coast (although I&#8217;m a SoCal girl by nature). I wish the water up here was warmer, but even so I love just watching the water. I feel very lucky that I can go running along the bike path on West Cliff Drive.
  
<font color=blue>3. Favorite Show on NPR? </font>
  
Marketplace! I love that show. Also like Morning Edition and All Things Considered. I would love CarTalk if only I were able to listen to it at a time that&#8217;s convenient to me. Maybe now that I have a Serius satellite radio I can find a time that I can listen to it. If only there were a Tivo for my radio ðŸ™‚
  
<font color=blue>4. I love baking too! What&#8217;s your favorite kind of pie? </font>
  
The pie I want to get really good at is the Graham Cracker Cream Pie my aunt used to make, but the pie I&#8217;m best at now is my kabocha pumpkin pie. I keep meaning to post the recipe, but I haven&#8217;t yet. Heck, I promised to post the recipe for Molasses cookies but I haven&#8217;t done that yet either. But I will!
  
<font color=blue>5. What did you think of Martha&#8217;s Poncho?</font>
  
Well, it was ugly. But I think that it was a very sweet gesture for someone to make her a poncho, and extremely sweet for her to acknowledge it like she did. I think that [Manolo](http://www.shoeblogs.com) was a little overly mean about it. On the other hand, it \*was\* ugly.
