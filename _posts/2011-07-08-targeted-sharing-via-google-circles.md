Like many of you, I have a Twitter account, a LinkedIn account, a Facebook account, and I have my tweets go to LinkedIn and Facebook so that I can lazily update everyone when I have something to say.  The resulting stream ends up being pretty spammy and unfocused, and so I post much less frequently than I might.  My &#8220;regular&#8221; friends feel like I&#8217;m super spammy, and my &#8220;geeky&#8221; friends complain they never hear from me.  This is exactly the kind of problem that G+ circles should be able to solve.

For this reason, and also because I love mashing stuff up, I can&#8217;t wait until G+ releases their APIs.  I want to build (or use) integrations with other systems so I don&#8217;t spend all my life bouncing from social network to social network &#8211; or pretending to engage in them by tossing messages over from other systems.

I&#8217;d love to have a LinkedIn circle, a Twitter circle, and a Facebook circle, so when I share something that I intend for my LinkedIn audience I can just add them and it&#8217;ll appear in my LinkedIn stream.   Now that I have G+ I don&#8217;t spend much time at all on Facebook (although I do on LinkedIn) and I feel a little guilty .  G+ could add this integration themselves, or third party developers (like me) could create applications that do the shuttling from place to place.  I&#8217;d love to have one place to keep my stream &#8211; and decide what other streams should get any given update.  This would make me much more likely to participate actively, because I could protect my less-geeky friends from seeing updates about semantic web visualizations.  And honestly, it&#8217;ll be a long time before everyone I know is on G+ (if ever) so I do want to make sure my Farmville-addicted friends see my updates too.

I&#8217;d also love to see incoming integration.  For instance, Runkeeper integration would totally rock.  It already takes input from my FitBit, so everything&#8217;s in RunKeeper, so I could send those updates to my Fitness circle of people-who-actually-care-about-my-training.  My Runkeeper updates go to Facebook, but again, it&#8217;s kind of spammy.  I&#8217;m generally more ok with dumping everything to Facebook because the stream is so noisy to begin with, but I&#8217;d really rather target those messages to folks who have an interest in hearing about it.

So, G+, can we have some APIs soon?
