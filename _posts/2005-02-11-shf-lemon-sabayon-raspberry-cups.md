My first entry into the Sugar High Fridays. I went ahead and used the freezer pastry dough because as I recall Jacques Torres said it was just fine to do. So here it is. Frankly, it&#8217;s a little oozier than I would have liked, I probably should have cooked it for longer but I was tired of stirring &#8211; sabayon takes some serious arm strength! Still, it tasted great and the raspberries really set off the sabayon nicely.
  
Freezer pastry shells, 1 pkg
  
Raspberries, 1 cup
  
Sabayon Filling:
  
8 egg yolks
  
1/2 cup sugar
  
4 Tbsp Marsala Wine
  
4 Tbsp Lemon zest
  
2 tsp Lemon oil
  
2 Tbsp Lemon juice
  
1. Pre-cook the cups as described on the package
  
2. Mix together lemon zest and sugar
  
3. Add sugar mixture to egg yolks and whisk till &#8216;sunny&#8217; yellow
  
4. Add lemon oil
  
4. Over double boiler, heat mixture whisking constantly until mixture thickens
  
5. Drizzle marsala in a little at a time to thin
  
6. Heat and thicken sabayon over double boiler again
  
7. Let stand 2 minutes. Set up cups
  
8. Fill cups with sabayon, let set for 5 minutes
  
9. Cover with raspberries and powdered sugar or whipped cream
