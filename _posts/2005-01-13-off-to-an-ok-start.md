Jiu Sool Do Class: 90 minutes
  
Well, I came in under my target calorie goal and did an ok job, but my nutritional profile was a little too fat/sugar heavy. Ended up with 2 chanticos and some supplemental chocolate because they were giving them away for free. We&#8217;ll try to improve on that for future days&#8230; I did hit my protein target, didn&#8217;t get in enough produce.
  
On the other hand, I went to martial arts and worked very hard for 90 minutes &#8211; probably burned around a thousand calories.
  
I will do some measurements over the weekend and post those in the sidebar, along with my weight and upcoming race goals.
