OK, where did it go? I had a skein of silk yarn for Susan&#8217;s Hallowig. You&#8217;ve seen pictures, I know I had it around here somewhere&#8230; where could it be? I&#8217;ve checked my office (which is really more of a craft room &#8211; I work from my recliner in the family room). I&#8217;ve checked my van. I&#8217;ve checked all my knitting bags (which were selected because they&#8217;re CLEAR and I can see what&#8217;s in them). But it&#8217;s nowhere to be found! How can a ball of yarn (I think it&#8217;s a ball&#8230; pretty sure I wound it) disappear like that? Did I maybe leave it in the room at Disneyland? \*sigh\* I would be certain that the dryer ate it like some errant sock, except that I&#8217;m certain that it&#8217;s never even seen the laundry room. Perhaps the van ate it. That vehicle definitely has a mind of its own.
  
Until I solve this mystery, I&#8217;m getting started on some [Broad Ripple socks](http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEsummer03/PATTbroadripple.html) for Susan (she&#8217;s allergic to wool), and someday I will be ordering some 60&#8243; needles so I can make my kitty a cozy moebius bed. Just as soon as I remember to bring my wallet in from the car because Jimmy Beans Wool doesn&#8217;t take Amex and that&#8217;s the only card number I&#8217;ve got memorized. I really need to make this kitty bed because my arm is in constant danger of some kind of circulation disorder from the 17 pound cat lying atop it while I type. Ironically enough, I&#8217;ll probably miss having him squishing me when he&#8217;s got a cozy bed to lie in. Maybe our other cat will take up residence instead.
  
In the meantime, some wonderful anonymous person sponsored me for the Revlon Run/Walk, bringing my online total to $396! A friend has promised $50 so I&#8217;m over $400&#8230; the mind boggles. The pictures have been posted from my race last Sunday &#8211; I put them on my [Fitness Blog](http://fitness.domestigirl.com/). Go ahead, take a look! I love race photos, they&#8217;re my favorite part of racing. OK, I can tell you&#8217;re not going to go look, so I&#8217;ll include a gratuitous race photo here too:

Even though I have somehow lost a $20 skein of yarn it&#8217;s been a good week:
  
&#8211; I had a better time than expected for the race
  
&#8211; My son had a fabulous week at kindergarten (new teacher, major upheaval, he&#8217;s not good with change, but he did great!)
  
&#8211; Susan will (hopefully!) be moved back to Santa Cruz on Monday
  
&#8211; I had a good work week this week &#8211; got a couple of nasty coding tasks out of the way
  
So in general it&#8217;s been a good week. But still, where **did** I put that yarn?
