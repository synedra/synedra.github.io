One of my best friends in the world was critically injured yesterday in an automobile accident. Nobody&#8217;s fault, slippery mountain road, bad visibility, her van spun out and hit a tree. It was a huge blessing that the two kindergarten-aged children in her car were basically unhurt but she was, as I said, critically injured. She was stabilized at our local hospital and flown to one of the best trauma centers in the world (Stanford), and last night the doctors performed surgery and miraculously stabilized her. She still has several surgeries ahead of her, and she needs whatever prayers and healing thoughts you might be able to offer.
  
I need to tell you what a wonderful woman this is. She is the godmother of my children and has been a huge part of my life for several years. She is an amazing cook, a wonderful Jewish mom, a phenomenal friend and just generally a brilliant light in the world. She&#8217;s also sometimes bossy, tends to over-commit, very sensitive, so totally human. I am extremely fortunate to have such a person as my friend, and I am honored to be able to help during this time by offering her son a place to stay so her husband can concentrate on her during this fragile time.
  
I believe strongly and completely in the power of prayer and positive thought to help someone through something like this, so if you have a moment, please send out some good thoughts in the general direction of Stanford, California, or light a candle in her honor.
  
Thanks&#8230;
