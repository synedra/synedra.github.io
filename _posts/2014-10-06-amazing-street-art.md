In London, I stayed at the Hoxton Hotel, and was treated to an amazing transformation outside of my hotel window.  Note that these pics were taken in panoramic mode on my iPhone 5s, and I claim no excellent technique or even motivation to do anything other than share this beautiful art.  As far as I am concerned, the photos are free for public use, and the ownership for this stuff belongs with the artists themselves.  There are larger resolution versions available if anyone wants to clean them up.

And here&#8217;s the finished wall a day later:
