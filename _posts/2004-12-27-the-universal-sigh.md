For all my ranting during the last week, I think my favorite part of the holidays wouldn&#8217;t be possible if I weren&#8217;t coming down off of the total frantic pre-Christmas blitz. Running around to find just the right thing for the people I love, fighting the maddened crowds, marvelling at people&#8217;s snarly ferocity during this time of celebration, all of this makes it possible for me to appreciate this week, which is quite possibly my favorite time of the year.
  
The week between Christmas and New Years is always, for me, a time of reflection. A time to remember what&#8217;s important &#8211; what (and who) I was doing all that frantic thrashing for. To celebrate all that I have, and start thinking about what I want to improve in the New Year. Not for me, those quickie poundage resolutions. I like to make resolutions which are personally meaningful, which help bring me closer to the person I want to become. I&#8217;d love to say that I&#8217;m making progress in seeking zen mastery, but the eventual goal is so far away it&#8217;s hard to tell if I&#8217;ve closed the gap any.
  
So I will make resolutions involving taking time for myself, making time for my family, lowering my general level of anxiety&#8230; read some books, cook some meals, improve my martial arts skills, knit some fabulous items. Perhaps this year I will run a road race. I haven&#8217;t decided on the particulars yet, but the most important thing I can gain is perspective &#8211; and that&#8217;s what I always manage to discover during this week.
  
And I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the only one. As I meet people on the street, see their relaxed, open expressions, I realize that we&#8217;re all caught in a universal sigh &#8211; that coming down off of the massive adrenaline rush of the last couple of weeks helps clear our vision.
  
So c&#8217;mon everyone&#8230; with me&#8230; let&#8217;s all take a deep, cleansing breath and wash away all the stress of the holidays. Let&#8217;s start the new year clearheaded so we can be the change we want to see in the world.
  
Namaste.
