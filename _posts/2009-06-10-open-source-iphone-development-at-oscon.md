Developing applications for mobile devices is often a daunting thought for those of us more comfortable in the land of high-level languages. &nbsp;However, in the wake of the new iPhone announcement,&nbsp;I thought I would check out the mobile development offerings at [OSCON](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/) to see if there was anything I could sink my teeth into. &nbsp;It turns out that it&#8217;s become much easier to create content for the iPhone without having to turn to objective C.

    The most intriguing tutorial I found was an introduction to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8020">PhoneGap</a>&nbsp;project, a platform which makes it easy for developers to create applications which work on the iPhone as well as several other mobile platforms. &nbsp;A developer creates a web application using Javascript/HTML, and the framework provides a wrapper for this application which works as a native application on the mobile device. &nbsp;The tutorial covers development under <a href="http://phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a> as well as the administrivia needed to get the resulting application into the App Store. &nbsp;I was curious about how well this kind of framework could work for general iPhone applications, so I browsed through their applications page and found a variety of applications including highly rated games and locationally-aware utilities. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll be excited to hear more about it at OSCON so I can get started playing with it.

    I do have a macintosh, which has up until now been a requirement for most iPhone development &#8211; but for those of you who aren&#8217;t in the Cult of Jobs, another <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8314">tutorial</a> gives you the information you need to develop for the iPhone using open source tools on Linux or Windows.

    Later in the week, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/speaker/2404">Ian Dees</a> will be talking about&nbsp;<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8073">testing your iPhone apps using Ruby and Cucumber</a>, and <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/speaker/25067">Patrick Collson</a> will be telling you how to turn your iPhone into the Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy. &nbsp;OK, actually he&#8217;ll just be talking about how they managed to cram Wikipedia into the iPhone, but it&#8217;s pretty much the same thing, isn&#8217;t it?

    Of course, you still have to get a developer&#8217;s license from Apple before you can create an installable application for the iPhone. &nbsp;If you&#8217;re curious about iPhone development, these sessions should help you decide if you want to jump in and give it a try. &nbsp;
