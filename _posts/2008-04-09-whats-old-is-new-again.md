I swear I meant to write this post a month ago, and in a horrible burst of irony never managed to find the time to do so, but here it is anyhow. I think I should warn everyone that my only degree is in Philosophy, and I&#8217;ve managed to shove that part of me down for a while, but apparently navel-gazing is the new black and so I&#8217;m dusting off my old philosophical thoughts and letting them out to play.
  
My friends were all reading [A New Earth](http://www.amazon.com/New-Earth-Awakening-Lifes-Purpose/dp/0525948023), and since I wanted to find out what the fuss was about I instructed my Kindle to fetch it for me and set to reading it. After reading it, I had a few thoughts&#8230;
  
First, I&#8217;m very pleased that Oprah is encouraging people to read and discuss things like this. These topics are important in our lives and by and large we just don&#8217;t make the space for them. Along with that I am highly amused that Tolle chose to cast Jesus as the ultimate Taoist. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the bible is all filled with examples of what a zen individual Jesus was, but the churches in our world today tend to shy away from this kind of thought.
  
My main impression of the book is that it&#8217;s a nice melding of Taoist and existentialist philosophies, which I tend to like because those are two of my favorites. And reading it reminded me that I need to consciously take the time to remember the things that are important to me. Letting things go that don&#8217;t serve me is something that regularly escapes my priority list, and my internal list says this is more important than anything else.
  
I did come to a realization after reading the book (although it was ideas I&#8217;d processed before). I spend way too much of my time feeling guilty that I can&#8217;t do all the things I want to do. I have my priorities &#8211; my family, my work, my friends. And so many other things seem cool and wonderful, and I keep wanting to engage with new groups of people doing new things, that when I can&#8217;t find the space I feel sad&#8230; which is silly. The reason I can&#8217;t find space for new things is that my life is filled with wonderful friends and family, and a fabulous job. I&#8217;m not willing to give up any of my current things to have new things, and that&#8217;s perfectly reasonable.
  
Oh yeah, one other thing. One of my priorities has always been my health (even though I let it slip in importance sometimes) and to that end I&#8217;m doing the Danskin Triathlon at Disneyland this year &#8211; I&#8217;ve even talked some of my friends into joining me, and I&#8217;m really excited about it. I even made a website for our training and encouraging. So I guess that makes it family, friends, work and health. Oh, and singing! I&#8217;ve decided that&#8217;s important too, and I&#8217;m going to sign up for a class. But that&#8217;s it! Nothing else! If only I didn&#8217;t live in such an amazing town, I wouldn&#8217;t have to make these terribly difficult choices.
