Sadly (or happily, depending on your perspective), the world is full of sweet little things. Sweet adorable girls, trying to pull knitted hats off their heads&#8230;

&#8230; and incredibly sweet small cups full of concentrated evil&#8230;

Have any of the rest of you encountered this particular drink? Starbuck&#8217;s new ultra-rich chocolate drink &#8211; Chantico. 6 ounces of super-concentrated chocolate. Evil. Pure, unadulterated evil.
  
However, I will use it as a carrot to get me started on my fitness kick, so I suppose it&#8217;s a good thing &#8211; any day where I work out at least 45 minutes I may have a Chantico. No workout, no chantico. And if I have one early, I must then find a way to work out sometime that day. I have no excuse, there&#8217;s a treadmill in the guest bedroom.
  
Speaking of which, it&#8217;s time for me to get off to martial arts! I have taped episodes of Lost and West Wing to watch, so I have hopes of getting more Irish Hiking Scarf done (or finishing it?)
  
If anyone&#8217;s wondering, the little girl in the hat actually likes it, she would just rather chew on it than wear it. Trendsetter Blossom is so soft, it makes great baby gifts!
  
It&#8217;s Knitty Secret Pal season, gotta find something really cool to send off ðŸ™‚
