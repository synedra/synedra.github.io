As a field services engineer, I&#8217;m becoming more and more aware of the various levels of customer service I see around me, and the effects they have on my (and other customers&#8217;) behavior.
  
Case in point: My hosting service had issues several months ago. It took 4 days to receive an initial response to my support query, and by then I&#8217;d basically created a workaround on my own. Since the problem was fixed, I stayed with that hosting service, but when I had another problem with them last month I ditched them without waiting for them to respond to my support request. I just plain didn&#8217;t feel like waiting&#8230; I moved over to [Living Dot](http://www.livingdot.com/), a hosting service which costs more but has great reviews (including warm praises from one of my [friends](http://www.fickleknitter.com/archives/2005_12.htm#000381)) for support. Sure enough, they went above and beyond on everything I asked them to do (and a few things I didn&#8217;t ask for). I&#8217;m happy to pay a few extra dollars for this kind of service. It&#8217;ll take some major wild horses to drag me away from these people.
  
Spending several days at Disneyland also reminded me of the value of customer service. I don&#8217;t even like the place that much&#8230; I mean, it&#8217;s fun, and the atmosphere is nice, and the kids love it, but, you know, \*eh\*. I&#8217;ve been there a zillion times. It&#8217;s expensive and crowded. I even worked there for a summer. However, every single cast member I encountered left me with a little extra smile in my day, and that makes for a very pleasant vacation, even when you&#8217;re waiting in line to see singing dolls.
  
One of the customers of my new company has been frustrated recently, and it turns out that a lot of that frustration has to do, not with our actual product or productivity, but with their feeling that we&#8217;re not listening to them. Hiring a field engineer (me) was a big part of our company&#8217;s strategy for improving this, but it&#8217;s always good to look around and see how good customer support is done to see if there&#8217;s any lessons to learn. We will do better, we \*are\* doing better, but I&#8217;d love to have our customers feel that we go above and beyond&#8230; it makes for some very loyal customers.
  
Of course, everybody has a different idea about what good customer service is. Google for &#8216;good customer service&#8217; and look at the dizzying array of opinions&#8230; to me, it&#8217;s really not complicated. And it certainly doesn&#8217;t need complicated rules. Listen to your customers. Don&#8217;t do that annoying thing where you play &#8216;find the buzzword&#8217; in what they&#8217;re saying and turn off your ears once they hit one. Just&#8230; listen. And try to think about how you can make their experience better (which is easier if you really listen).
  
PS: on my Disney vacation I got some work done on a moebius scarf I&#8217;m working on for Devon&#8217;s teacher. I&#8217;m looking forward to actually having a knitting thing to show off&#8230; hoping I might get a new camera for my birthday to make picture taking even more fun.
