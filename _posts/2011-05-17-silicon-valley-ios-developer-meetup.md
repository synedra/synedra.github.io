Last night was the [Silicon Valley iOS Developer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/sviphone/events/15450118/) hosted here at LinkedIn. I talked through a sample client for the iPhone which iOS developers can use as a springboard for creating their own LinkedIn-powered apps.

Slides can be found [here](/assets/img/2011/05/iPhone-Presentation.pdf).
