We never did get to the [Stitch &#8216;n Bitch](http://artyoucanwear.com/stitchnbitch/), darn it. I had to finish up my [Sweet Potato Bread Pudding](http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/archives/2004/12/sweet_potato_br.html) for dinner at a friend&#8217;s house so I couldn&#8217;t get down there. Nevertheless, I did get some more work done on the Irish Hiking Scarf&#8230; I dragged it along to breakfast, I invited it along to our friends&#8217; house, I pretty much took it everywhere because, good grief, Christmas is approaching pretty darned quickly. It&#8217;s a little over a foot long now&#8230; I&#8217;m very proud of it for my first real project. I was a leetle bit unsure whether I&#8217;d be able to pull this off, but I think I&#8217;ll officially join the [KnitAlong](http://irishhikingknitalong.blogspot.com/) now. It still seems to be pretty slow going but I&#8217;ve got 2 weeks so I&#8217;m optimistic, especially now that I&#8217;ve stopped serially frogging the thing.

Took a break from the scarf today to make a hat from some funky novelty yarn. My cat Stormy is quite pleased with my new hobby. Anything involving yarn and sitting in the recliner is ok by him. Fortunately he&#8217;s old enough to be able to resist the siren call of wiggling yarn, or we&#8217;d have to have some serious words.

The thing whizzed by and was done in a couple of hours&#8230; Here&#8217;s my daughter modelling it &#8211; fortunately her head is pretty much exactly the same size as my mother-in-law&#8217;s, and it fits just fine. Woo! The thread was some Linie 191 Maxima acrylic chenille, on size 15 needles. I cast on 42 and knit in the round for 7 inches and then reduced somewhat randomly &#8211; about K4, K2tog and then sewed up the middle from the inside. And voila, a hat perfect for someone who loves flamingos and other such quirky things.

In other weekend project news, my husband finally put up our cool magnetic dry-erase board thing. It&#8217;s totally cool&#8230; and now we can see the front of our refrigerator again. I got the idea from Real Simple, gotta love that magazine.

Got most of the kids&#8217; Xmas presents ordered and it feels like we actually got some stuff accomplished this weekend.
  
Gotta run, I hear some iced tea calling my name!
