I&#8217;ve been quiet but I \*have\* been working out! I went to martial arts Monday, Wednesday, Thursday which was great. I should run today but I&#8217;m taking the day off to be a complete flake. My friend is coming in today for the Stitches West convention, maybe we can get in a run tomorrow morning before we head over the hill, that would be great.
  
Looking forward to my Mental Health day today! I&#8217;ll try to get in a couple of 2 mile runs over the weekend. That 12K is in a month, gotta be ready!
  
Looks like measurement weekend again, I&#8217;ll update my numbers after I wrestle with the measuring tape. I \*seem\* smaller to me, but I may not be the most objective source around.
