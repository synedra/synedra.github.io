Yes! There is a finished object in my house! What&#8217;s that you say? You don&#8217;t believe I finished a knitted item? Well&#8230; I would be insulted if it weren&#8217;t such a reasonable question. And true. Because actually the object was not technically finished by me. It&#8217;s the hat my daughter made for her teacher, and all I did was cast on and bind off.
  
My moebius scarf is getting bound off tonight, and then I can help Victoria with hers (which is going to be her grandma&#8217;s Christmas present&#8230; shhh!!!)
