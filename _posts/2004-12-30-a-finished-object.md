I&#8217;ve been making some progress on that Irish Hiking Scarf and it&#8217;s almost 3 feet long now. I have hope that I may someday be able to present it as a finished object. In the meantime, I will be seeing one of my very small friends tomorrow and I made her a belated Christmas present:

It&#8217;s cute. She&#8217;s cuter. The combination may be deadly. I&#8217;ll be sure and post a picture of her with the hat if I can get one. Yarn was Trendsetter Blossom, the pattern was from Last Minute Knitted Gifts. I learned how to make a pompom today. Go me.
  
My daughter wanted to go to our LYS yesterday after we went to the fabric store and got her a pattern to sew on her machine. She wanted to talk to the yarn ladies about a problem with her knitting. Remember, this is the daughter who previously knitted 2 scarves. Anyhow, she&#8217;s working on a purse thing. In we went, and I headed for the back so I could wallow in the knitting books. She shyly approached the ladies and showed them her knitting. I heard her say &#8220;but there&#8217;s all these&#8230; holes!&#8221; Yep, my daughter&#8217;s knitting has holes. But the good kind! The right kind! All is well in purse-land. What a relief.
  
I got an email today informing me that [Knitting Arts](http://www.goknit.com/) is having a holiday sale next week. I may have to go and get some more needles. After much consideration, I&#8217;ve decided that I love Inox needles. I have wooden needles, Denise interchangeables, acrylic needles in groovy colors, and Inox needles. The Inox are, by far, my faves. I love their feel, I love their sound. I need more. Thank goodness for sales.
  
I feel somewhat strange posting about such mundane things while SouthEast Asia is still dealing with so much tragedy. I gave what I could to the relief efforts &#8211; there are many worthy organizations listed on the [NPR](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4248155) website if you haven&#8217;t found one you like yet.
  
If you need me, I&#8217;ll be over here&#8230; counting my blessings yet again.
