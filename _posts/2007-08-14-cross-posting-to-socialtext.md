A while back, at the [Movable Type Hackathon](http://lifewiki.net/sixapart/GlobalMTHackathon), I created a Movable Type plugin which allows a blog author to crosspost a blog entry to a Socialtext wiki (with or without tags, as desired). For example, this entry simultaneously posted to my [blog](http://www.perlgoddess.org/perlgoddess/) and the [Socialtext Open workspace](http://www.socialtext.net/open/index.cgi?cross_posting_to_socialtext).

Now SixApart is looking for people to create [plugins](http://plugins.movabletype.org/) for their 4.0 beta version. I&#8217;ve decided to update the Socialtext posting plugin so it works with 4.0, and also add some better behavior in the process.
  
As an aside, I installed MT4 on my macintosh so that I could do this development, because my hosting company (sweet though they are) aren&#8217;t willing to install MT4 until it&#8217;s stable. I can live with that for now, although I might just do it myself if I get a wild hair. I&#8217;ve been playing with it for a couple of hours and have to say it&#8217;s really an amazing evolution from the previous version &#8211; much more intuitive and powerful. I&#8217;m quite impressed with the work done by the SixApart guys on this one.
  
Sadly, dropping in the 3.2 version doesn&#8217;t just magically work so I&#8217;ll need to do some fussing with it to get it working, but looking at the new API and example plugins I&#8217;m pretty excited to dig in and get it working.
  
If you&#8217;re hankering for the 3.2 version let me know, and I&#8217;ll put it somewhere people can get it. Or you can wait for the new shiny 4.0 version, which I&#8217;m planning to get done sometime this week.
