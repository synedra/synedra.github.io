I&#8217;ve been plugging along on my training, working on getting my &#8216;speed&#8217; up (if you can call it that). This weekend my friend and I did 5K, in preparation for the [10K](http://www.firstwave-events.com/sc_half/) this weekend. It should be fun, we&#8217;re hoping to maintain 15 minute miles although that might be a bit optimistic.
  
Next month I&#8217;m flying down to SoCal to run in the Revlon Run/Walk for Women &#8211; this race raises money for outreach programs and research focussing on women&#8217;s cancer issues. If you&#8217;d like to be a sponsor, please click on the &#8216;sponsor me&#8217; link in the sidebar. I&#8217;m even running a raffle on my [knitting blog](http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/) so you might win something cool while providing money for this important cause.
