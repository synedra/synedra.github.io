I pointed my other site to this site so I thought I should probably do a quick update on how I&#8217;m doing with my lap band. My lap band was inserted on 7/27/2001. In the first year I lost 72 pounds. I got down below 200 but have since regained back up to 220 (I was very sick for several months, not related to the lap band but resulting in some weight gain). I am not currently focussed on weight loss &#8211; I&#8217;m happy with my size 16/18 body and I am very active. In the last year, I have:

  * Played on a softball team 
      * Tap danced in 2 recitals (yes, in a skimpy costume) 
          * Trained and competed in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 
              * Attained a medium-high belt in Kuk Sool Won (martial arts) 
                  * Started running again
  
                    I generally work out 4-5 times a week.
  
                    I am healthy and I feel that my lap band experience was a good one. If I were more focussed on weight loss, I could easily lose down to my ultimate goal of 185, but at this point I&#8217;m working on overall health so I keep my restriction more &#8216;generous&#8217;. I have no trouble at all maintaining my weight where it is, and I know from experience that if I worked a bit more on good food choice I would probably start dropping weight again &#8211; I may well do that after the yummy stuff of the holidays evaporates. For now, happy holidays. I&#8217;ll update this category again every few months so folks know what&#8217;s going on with me. I don&#8217;t have any full sized pictures at this point but I will soon&#8230;
  
                    Feel free to check out the rest of my site to see what&#8217;s going on in my life now &#8211; as you can see I&#8217;m no longer just a &#8216;lap band&#8217; person but I&#8217;ve got so much more time and energy that I&#8217;m doing all kinds of fun stuff.
