This is a fabulous looking and very tasty breakfast treat, again based on a recipe from [Cuisine at Home magazine](http://www.cuisinemag.com/) &#8211; you can do all the preparation the night before and then just pop it into the oven in the morning. It tastes as good as it looks, and it&#8217;s very easy to prepare.
  
Ingredients:
  
&#8211; 1 box puff pastry dough
  
&#8211; 2 T. unsalted butter
  
&#8211; 1 cup frozen shredded or cubed hash brown potatoes
  
&#8211; 1/2 cup onion , diced
  
&#8211; 2 T. minced fresh chives
  
(the above 2 ingredients can be substitued by 1 T. onion powder)
  
&#8211; 1 cup smoked ham or smoked salmon (optional)
  
&#8211; 12 eggs
  
&#8211; 4 oz. cream cheese, softened
  
&#8211; 2 T. orange juice (if preparing ahead)
  
&#8211; 1 T. water
  
&#8211; 2 T. Parmesan cheese, shredded or grated
  
Preheat oven to 400 degrees, thaw pastry according to package directions (around 30 minutes)
  
Melt butter over medium-high heat in a largish skillet. Add potatoes and saute until slightly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in onion, saute until soft, then add ham/salmon.
  
Whisk 11 of the eggs together with the chives. Add them to the pan and scramble just until set. They should still be &#8216;wet&#8217; &#8211; at this point, stir in the cream cheese and juice until blended. Refrigerate the egg mixture while you prepare the pastry.
  
Unfold a pastry sheet on a sheet of parchment paper. It almost always cracks at the seams, so wet your fingers and press at the seams to fix them up. You can roll it on a floured surface until it&#8217;s longer (about 12&#215;10) to get a longer pastry, but it works fine unrolled as well. You need to trim and pre-cut it so it looks like this picture:

Glop about 1/2 of the egg mixture onto the pastry and start braiding:

After your pastries are braided they&#8217;ll look kinda funny. Don&#8217;t worry about it&#8230;

At this point you can refrigerate the prepared pastries in the refrigerator &#8211; lightly cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying.
  
When you&#8217;re ready to cook them, combine the remaining egg and water, brush over the tops of the strudels. Sprinkle with parmesan and bake 25-30 minutes, or until golden. Enjoy!
