I had a great birthday yesterday. We went to my favorite dinner spot and had a fun meal, and then we came home and had some cake which my fabulous husband baked for me (because you can&#8217;t get a bakery to make yellow cake which is my favorite):

Why yes, that is a Barbie candle. No, I&#8217;m not 5. I just felt like having a Barbie candle, whaddya wanna make of it? In any case it was a prescient candle for the rest of my birthday.
  
I got a bunch of cool stuff in a &#8216;pink&#8217; motif &#8211; a pink cashmere sweater from J. Jill (with pink chenille socks), some fabulous earrings in pink mother-of-pearl with rose gold, and from my amazingly crafty and cool [friend](http://recklesscraft.blogspot.com/) made me the most wonderful birthday present:

My name, and &#8220;Domestigirl&#8221;. Stitched in Pink! It is just so cool. That thing dangling down from the (pink!) ribbon is a yarn cutter &#8211; she pointed out that if you have scissors, people tend to &#8216;borrow&#8217; them and you never see them again. This yarn cutter is a very specific tool and you can&#8217;t do anything but cut yarn, so everyone else leaves it alone.
  
After my stressful week, I&#8217;m tempted to call the Mobile Yarn Sales lady and see if she has any yarn that I need. It sounds so decadent, having someone bring yarn to my house to feed my addiction. I could lie on the chaise, being fanned by my husband, eating peeled grapes, and have her bring my yarn right to me. Or, you know, I could just get back to working on the Irish Hiking Scarf. We&#8217;ll see&#8230;
