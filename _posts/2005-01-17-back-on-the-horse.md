Exercise: ![Picture here](http://fitness.domestigirl.com/images/stars_3_50.gif)
  
Run/Walk 1/2 minutes: 35 minutes, 2.25 miles, 350 calories
  
Martial Arts class: 45 minutes
  
Chantico, yes. Rest of day: pretty good, I actually just didn&#8217;t eat enough&#8230; so my protein was lacking and so was my fiber. Calorie wise it was nifty though
  
The running was great, although it kicked my ass. During the running intervals I&#8217;m trying to go 6 MPH which is faster than my usual running pace (closer to a 14 minute mile than a 10 minute mile). My heartrate goes way up so the workout is hard, but I want to see if I can increase my speed, and since I&#8217;m only running 1 minute out of 3 this seems like the time to try&#8230; my heartrate recovers fine (down to 130) before I start the next segment so I think it&#8217;s a good strategy.
  
Bless my husband for letting me use his ipod. Mine is apparently too old &#8211; the Apple store no longer carries power cords for the thing. Ugh. Running is a lot more fun when you&#8217;ve got fun music to run to!
