As most of my readers have probably noticed, I tend to keep a lot on my plate at once. I&#8217;ve got a lot of energy, and a lot of things I want to do with that energy. However, I&#8217;m not necessarily good (who am I kidding, I&#8217;m completely awful) at the whole &#8216;day-to-day&#8217; things that other people magically achieve. Keeping track of my keys/phone/credit cards. Making/keeping appointments. Yes, I have ical and it&#8217;s very nice&#8230; when I remember to start it up. It even puts schedule on my phone&#8230; when I remember to tell it to sync.
  
Anyhow, one of the things about which I am so neglectful is my car. Thank heavens it&#8217;s a Honda so it doesn&#8217;t need much attention, but periodically, yes, I need to have it serviced. Last time I had it serviced was \*waves hands vaguely\* a while ago, and about a month ago I noticed that my brakes were squeaky and I made a mental note that I \*should\* make an \*appointment\* to get the brakes fixed (oh, and an oil change too). This morning I realized the squeak was gone and the squish had appeared. Uh oh.
  
Now, usually what I do at this point is to call and make an appointment with the auto guy for 3 weeks from yesterday and spend all of the intervening time certain that my brakes are going to go out, killing my family, because I am a flake. Oh, I know, I could drive my husband&#8217;s car most of the time. But he doesn&#8217;t have satellite radio, so that&#8217;s out.
  
Anyhow, being as I am a research fiend, I checked [Monterey Bay Opinions](http://www.montereybayopinions.com) to see if I could find any highly rated local auto folks so I could start the ticking clock of anxiety before the brakes are actually fixed. I picked the most highly rated place and called them up. He said &#8220;I can fit you in any time after Tuesday&#8230;&#8221; (at this, my heart leaped. Tuesday, that&#8217;s not so bad!) &#8220;&#8230;or I had a cancellation today if you can come in right now.&#8221; Hurray! So now I&#8217;m sitting in Starbucks while my car becomes less squeaky and more safe. I&#8217;m very happy to have been so lucky &#8211; must be clean living or something.
  
I managed to unpack my yarn yesterday, so I can get back to work on those Fixation Broadripple Socks. Our house is starting to really shape up well, and I&#8217;m starting to feel somewhat less anxious about things in general&#8230; plus I&#8217;ve been assured that I will see the sun next month so I&#8217;m looking forward to that.
  
Oh hey, I also found my camera, so I will put up some pictures reallyreallyreally soon!
