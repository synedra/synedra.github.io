It always seems like Girl Scout weeks I end up madly running errands on Thursday and Friday and this week was no exception. And I didn&#8217;t get in my usual martial arts workout on Thursday (because I was learning how to make even more wonderful desserts) so I have now had 3 rest days in a row. Foo. Tomorrow my friend is coming over to run with me, so that&#8217;ll be a good way to kick start my workouts again. And there won&#8217;t be another Girl Scout meeting for 2 weeks so I&#8217;ll have some time to exercise before then!
  
Down to 215, though&#8230; 3 pounds off is a nice start.
