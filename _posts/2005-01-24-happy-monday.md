Martial Arts, 45 minutes
  
Running: 30 minutes (2 miles)
  
This weekend was a big wasteland of tasty junk food and rump-sitting. I was supposed to go running with my friend yesterday but her son came down with a high fever so she couldn&#8217;t go. Spurred on by irresistable forces like this I managed to do not really anything this weekend.
  
But it&#8217;s Monday! So back on the treadmill with me &#8211; I&#8217;m up to 2 minutes running and 2 minutes walking. I toned down the &#8216;running&#8217; speed to see if I could run for 2 minutes at 5 MPH without having my heartrate get over 170. The answer was&#8230; yes, the first 3 times. After that my body was a little more spiky with the heart rate but overall I&#8217;m pleased &#8211; when I&#8217;ve run previously I&#8217;ve had much more trouble with the spiking heart rate so I must be better conditioned than I thought, from all the martial arts I&#8217;ve been doing.
  
Only 2 weeks until my first event of the year &#8211; not anything spectacular, just the Super Bowl 3K, but I&#8217;m looking forward to it anyhow because then I&#8217;ll have a baseline for pace to improve upon.
