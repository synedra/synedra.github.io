OK, all you fabulous raffle prize winners, your stuff is In The Mail! Thanks again for your support, and of course for everyone else&#8217;s support as well! If you get your gift and think &#8216;that&#8217;s odd, she didn&#8217;t put in a note&#8217;, you can think one of two things. Either I&#8217;m just not a note person and wanted to get the stuff out anyhow, or maybe yours fell out onto my floor and I didn&#8217;t notice. One of those is certainly true.
  
Big changes abounding around here! We&#8217;ve decided to sell our house because currently, in our county, house prices are unbelievably high and rents are really quite reasonable. So we&#8217;ll sell and rent for a while, then probably buy some land and build our own house on it. Which means, of course, that we&#8217;ve been cleaning house like mad &#8211; we rented a dumpster which is sitting in our driveway, and we had a yard sale on Saturday &#8211; and sold some books to the used book store on Sunday. We made $500 at the yard sale (woo!) and then I discovered that you get more store credit when you&#8217;re an actual real grownup selling nice books than when you&#8217;re a college student trying to hawk 20 year old pocketbooks. Last time I sold books at Logo&#8217;s (circa 1988) I got $32 in store credit and was deliriously happy. This time, we got $422 in store credit. And that was just our first run through the books. I am doing my best to remain strong and resist going back to turn that store credit back into books that I&#8217;ll just have to move later but oh man, $422. Doesn&#8217;t it make your heart sing?
  
In knitting news, well, did I mention I&#8217;ve been cleaning my house? And that I sent out the prizes? Also, I have a bit of an embarrassing admission. Do you remember when I broke my ebony dpn by trying a sock on my foot? Well, uh, this time I just plain stepped on my knitting bag. \*crack\* Man, I am a klutz. I should only knit on metal needles. So I still haven&#8217;t really started the heel flap for Susan&#8217;s eternal socks because in order to do that I&#8217;ll have to face the snapped ebony dpn. But they will come, have faith.
  
Still haven&#8217;t started on that kitty bed after all my whining and kvetching about the super long addi&#8217;s. Somehow it seems like more of a fall/winter project. Fortunately I bought a dog bed which the dog has snubbed. And my kitty is enormous. So he fits right in there and he thinks it&#8217;s heavenly. I&#8217;ll still make him a felted bed but now the pressure is off. Maybe I&#8217;ll actually join the JFM knitalong and make that emerald tank!
  
And speaking of Susan, which I was a couple of paragraphs ago, she got to come to my house for our Memorial Day barbecue! She&#8217;s doing so great, it&#8217;s just amazing.
  
In other news, please cross your fingers for my boy &#8211; he only has to make it through 7 more days of kindergarten, remembering to listen relatively well and resist the siren call of peeing on the trees and he&#8217;ll get a super cool ride-on toy. And school will be out.
  
OK, enough babbling for now. Oh no, wait, not quite enough. Other than the wharf-to-wharf which I&#8217;ll be doing in July (and maybe the Jungle Run too) it looks like I&#8217;ll be doing 2 races in October &#8211; the [See Jane Tri Sprint Triathlon](http://envirosports.com/events/displayevent.php?eventid=1347) (it&#8217;s a little long for a sprint but whatever) and the [Nike Women&#8217;s Half Marathon](http://www.nike.com/nikemarathon/). With my friend who swore we wouldn&#8217;t run in San Francisco again. Why did she change her mind, you ask? I asked the same thing. And she said &#8220;They give all the finishers a custom made Tiffany necklace!&#8221; Well o-kay then. Why didn&#8217;t you just say so?
  
OK, now I&#8217;m done. No, really. I promise.
