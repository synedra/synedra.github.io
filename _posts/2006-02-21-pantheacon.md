Victoria and I went to [Pantheacon](http://www.pantheacon.com/) on Sunday and we had a wonderful time. We got matching henna tattoos on our hands, learned lots of circle dances, and attended a ritual celebrating young ladies such as herself. It was wonderful to spend the day with my daughter, celebrating and learning.
  
I&#8217;ve always wanted to spend time exploring wicca, but the kids have taken too much time to make it practical. But now my secret plan has come to fruition &#8211; my daughter is old enough to be interested on her own, and I can be supportive while doing what I wanted to do in the first place.
  
I&#8217;m so pleased to be such a tricksy mom ðŸ™‚
