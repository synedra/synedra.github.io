After growing up pretty much completely uninterested in anything domestic, I have turned into some kind of domestic fiend. In the hopes of sparing other people from my fate (or easing their transition into it), I&#8217;m going to join the infinite online blogverse and add my $0.02 to share all the fabulous insights (and dumb mistakes) I make as I stumble through my life.
  
Just to get started, here&#8217;s a picture of my current knitting project, from the [Irish Hiking Scarf Knitalong](http://irishhikingknitalong.blogspot.com/). It&#8217;s a fun pattern and not too hard (I haven&#8217;t been knitting very long) although I did frog the thing 7 times before getting it to this point.

I&#8217;ll list a bunch of factoids about myself so you know something about me&#8230; the idea was borrowed (with gratitude) from the [Yarn Harlot](http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog).Actually, it&#8217;s not 100 things. I&#8217;m not that interesting&#8230;
