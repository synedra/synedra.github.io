Every year I think that I&#8217;ll get my shopping all done by the end of October, and every year I&#8217;m frantically driving around 3 days before Christmas while trying to simultaneously work.
  
A little taste of the last 24 hours of my life:

  * Yesterday, I got a power cord for my ailing computer by driving 45 minutes so I could leap into the swirling maelstrom of the mall. Also wandered around with my dad to help him find a few items at various packed gadget stores. There were a myriad dazed men wandering around quivering slightly as they peered through the windows of the girly stores &#8211; clearly these brave souls had ventured forth through the black gates of hell to seek out presents for their significant others. I avoided contact, not wishing to startle the fragile souls. But I did silently wish them well.
  * This morning, before starting work, shuffled blearily through the drug store looking for stocking stuffer goodies (candy, etc). Managed to get out of there in only an hour.
  * During lunch time, I headed to the sewing machine store to get a sewing machine (from &#8220;santa&#8221;) for my daughter and a vacuum cleaner because ours just died. Encountered some very strange sales tactics on the vacuum cleaner but got one anyways because I&#8217;m tired of yarny fuzz on my carpets.
  * After work, my dad and I drove back near the swirling maelstrom to get my husband&#8217;s xmas present. Unfortunately, that close to the eye of the storm the traffic was abyssmal and we ended up taking over an hour to drive about a mile. I hope he cherishes his present.
  * We drove away from the vortex (whew) and entered the eerie deadness which is Vallco (a mall with very few actual shops, and thus very few actual shoppers). Visited my friend&#8217;s store so my dad could shop for a chess set.
  * Feeling accomplished and energized by our trip to deadsville, we headed over to Fry&#8217;s Electronics. Which you can&#8217;t really comprehend unless you live near the Silicon Valley. By this point I was near exhaustion and I found myself caught in an inescapable fugue standing in the remote control aisle, holding a $230 universal remote. Fortunately, some kind soul bumped into me, causing the evil item to slip from my grasp, breaking its spell.
  * Got a stocking stuffer for my dad there, he got the stuff he&#8217;d come for, so we headed for our &#8216;final destination&#8217;, Borders, where they were holding 2 knitting books for me to finish off my list once and for all.
  * Got to Borders, helped my dad find what he was looking for, grabbed a copy of &#8216;[Good Food&#8217;](http://www.bbcmagazines.com/goodfood/) (love that magazine), found a cool book called [Nesting &#8211; It&#8217;s a Chick Thing](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=domestigirl-20&path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0761131604%2Fqid%3D1103694621%2Fsr%3D1-3%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks) which I grabbed because it seemed like something I should really have. I headed for the counter to get my knitting books, but on the way there I remembered that I needed to get a cookbook for my son to complete his Santa Package. I wandered over and got one, went to the counter and paid for my books. About 10 minutes out of town I realized that I hadn&#8217;t actually picked up the darned knitting books. So I&#8217;ll have to get a knitting present for my last recipient at my LYS tomorrow, in between wrapping some 76 presents and preparing 685 cards for mailing. Maybe that&#8217;s an exaggeration. Maybe I&#8217;m just a little tired. I swear, next year I&#8217;m starting in August. Or maybe June. Actually, I think I&#8217;ll just buy all my presents next week and have done with it. </ul>
