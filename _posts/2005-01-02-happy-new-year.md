Happy New Year! I know, it&#8217;s a day late, but what the heck. We had a nice New Years Eve, went down to First Night Santa Cruz and saw [Zun Zun](http://www.zunzuntunes.com) and the [Taiko Drummers](http://www.watsonvilletaiko.org) (who were, if anything, better than ever this year!). We came home and hung out. Some of us made it to midnight&#8230; some of us didn&#8217;t:

I was hanging out trying to work on the Irish Hiking Scarf yesterday. Making good progress, the thing is now 37 inches long and I&#8217;ve just about finished my second skein, so I&#8217;m about 2/3 done (I intend it to be a little over 60 inches):

I&#8217;ve been working on my resolutions for the year. Like I said, I don&#8217;t like &#8216;lose 10 pounds&#8217; or anything like that because you can lose it in January, gain it back in February, and have accomplished precisely nothing.
  
I will do my very best this year to:
  
&#8211; Run in a race before June
  
&#8211; Knit a sweater for me (maybe [Blaze](http://knitty.com/ISSUEfall04/PATTblaze.html) (but not in orange)
  
&#8211; Turn all these balls of cotton yarn in to dishcloths from the [Dishcloth Boutique](http://www.jimsyldesign.com/~dishbout/kpatterns/knitting.html)

&#8211; Eat out for dinner no more than once a week
  
&#8211; Take the time to buy and prepare relatively healthful food for myself and my family
  
&#8211; Attend at least 3 martial arts classes a week
  
&#8211; Go back to pre-planning at least 48 hours ahead anything that causes me stress (girl scouts, get-togethers, anything where my tummy wrenches when I think about it)
  
&#8211; Move myself closer to zen mastery
  
My big plan is to take control of my life back away from the demons of chaos. I had a very stressful year, and much of that stress was due to me overcommitting to things, both in work and in the rest of my life. My new mantra will be &#8220;I can only do what I can do&#8221; which is still a lot, and the quality of my life is much better when I don&#8217;t try to be superwoman.
  
[Femail Creations](http://www.femailcreations.com), one of my favorite catalogs, is having a special deal on one of their plaques which is very apropos to my goals for the year. For every one they sell, they&#8217;ll donate $5 to the Red Cross tsunami relief fund. The image is linked to the catalog entry:

That&#8217;s my big resolution for this year. Find the time. Make the time. And of course&#8230; be the change I want to see in the world.
