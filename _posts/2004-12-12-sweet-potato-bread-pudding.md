I find lots of my favorite recipes in magazines and recently I&#8217;ve become very enamored of [Cuisine at Home](http://www.cuisinemag.com/). Of the 10 dishes I cooked over Thanksgiving weekend, 3 of them came from their November issue, and one of them was so popular I&#8217;ve made it for every gathering this year, always to rave reviews. The tang from the orange and cranberry combine with the sweet potato and streusel to create a wonderful alternative to the yam-marshmellow side dish at holiday gatherings. This dish is popular even with people who don&#8217;t care for sweet potatoes.
  
For the Pudding &#8211;
  
Whisk together:
  
&#8211; 1 cup sour cream
  
&#8211; 3/4 cup milk
  
&#8211; 3/4 cup sugar
  
&#8211; 3 eggs
  
&#8211; 1 T. baking powder
  
&#8211; 2 t. vanilla extract
  
&#8211; 1 t. ground ginger
  
&#8211; 1/2 t. kosher salt
  
&#8211; 1 cup dried cranberries
  
&#8211; peel of 1 orange
  
Mix this together with 4 cups of french bread, chopped into fine (1/2 inch) cubes.
  
Soak overnight (or for as long as possible)
  
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, coat a 1-qt. casserole dish with nonstick spray.
  
Cook and puree, then fold into bread mixture
  
&#8211; 1 lb sweet potatoes
  
For the streusel, combine and stir together:
  
&#8211; 1-1/2 cup pecans, chopped
  
&#8211; 1/2 cup brown sugar
  
&#8211; 1/3 cup all purpose flour
  
&#8211; 1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
  
If you like a finer streusel, throw this in the cuisinart and blend until it&#8217;s the consistency of cornmeal.
  
Pour the pudding into the casserole dish and cover with the streusel. Bake for 30 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Enjoy!
