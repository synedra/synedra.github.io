When last we left my intrepid tummy, we were headed to the gastro doc to talk about why it was so sad.  She decided I should have a colonoscopy to make sure my intestines weren&#8217;t problematic, and a CAT scan to make sure my pancreas wasn&#8217;t puffy.  So, after finishing my 3 weeks of the elimination diet, I spent a day drinking barium for the cat scan, and then later that week I spent a day eating clear liquids for the colonoscopy.

  Verdict: My pancreas is fine.  My intestines did have a flat polyp which she removed (hurray!)  No crohn&#8217;s, no other problems.

  So, we&#8217;re left with the likely problem of Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth.  I&#8217;ve done some research on this and I&#8217;ve found a program that seems to really be working. So, anyone in a similar situation can take heed and see if something like this will help you too:

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Enteric-coated peppermint oil.  This stuff is awesome.  It kills bacteria in your small intestine and reduces gas and bloating.  3x/day.  I&#8217;m gonna take this for a month and then switch to building up my flora, because I&#8217;m guessing the peppermint oil isn&#8217;t smart enough to distinguish between &#8220;good flora in the large intestine&#8221; and &#8220;misguided flora in the small intestine&#8221;
    </li>
    <li>
      Much less crap.  I&#8217;m trying to keep myself to foods which are as close to whole as possible.  I know, duh, but really, this is making a huge difference.  I&#8217;m making bread in my breadmaker almost every morning, making dinners from actual ingredients, avoiding foods that tend to cause acidity in your system.  I noticed that eating more <a href="http://www.greatestherbsonearth.com/articles/acid_alkaline.htm">alkaline-causing foods</a> made my body happier so I&#8217;m working on that.  Note that artificial sweeteners are the acidest foods of all.
    </li>
    <li>
      UltraClear Ph.  This is medical food that helps keep your Ph in the right place.  And it seems to help my system be happy.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    So much success I&#8217;m having on this plan that two days ago I WORE PANTS for the first time in 3 years.  And didn&#8217;t have to take them off from uncomfortable bloating.
