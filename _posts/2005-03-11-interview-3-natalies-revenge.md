Actually her questions are very nice, I just had to come up with a relatively witty title and I&#8217;m kinda sleepy this morning.
  
Here&#8217;s my answers to [Natalie&#8217;s](http://knitting.xaviermusketeer.com) reciprocal questions.
  
Kirsten:
  
<font color="blue">1. So update us on your New Yearâ€™s resolutions that you posted in January. How are you doing with them so far?</font>
  
What? I posted resolutions? Yow! I did! I had completely forgotten about them! OK, here they are, with my current progress (or the adaptation) included.
  
I will do my very best this year to:
  
&#8211; Run in a race before June
  
I did the Santa Cruz Super Bowl 3k on Super Bowl Sunday. Then came back to watch the game. Granted, 3k is pretty unimpressive but I was happy with my time. This month on the 20th I&#8217;m doing the Emerald Nuts Across the Bay 12K where I will get to run across the Golden Gate bridge.
  
&#8211; Knit a sweater for me (maybe Blaze (but not in orange)
  
Sheesh. It&#8217;s 80 degrees here right now, a sweater sounds kind of dumb. I will adjust this resolution a bit to say &#8216;knit some kinda shirty thing for me&#8217; since I have a zillion skeins of Noro Lily in this fabulous green color which is going to become a tank top sometime soon.
  
&#8211; Turn all these balls of cotton yarn in to dishcloths from the Dishcloth Boutique
  
Yeah, well, here&#8217;s the thing. I keep \*trying\* to start dishcloths. They should be cool, right? You start, then a little while later, you&#8217;re done. But I start one, do about 2 inches, and then grow unbelievably bored with the thing and frog it. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a dishcloth girl. I&#8217;ll find something else to do with the cotton, I&#8217;m sure.
  
&#8211; Eat out for dinner no more than once a week
  
We&#8217;re doing much better with this, although still too much eating out. The extra stuff I&#8217;m doing because of my friend&#8217;s accident has made me quite stressed and I&#8217;m just getting back on my feet from that. But we&#8217;re cooking more than eating out! And we implemented an allowance scheme that discourages the gratuitous eating out.
  
&#8211; Take the time to buy and prepare relatively healthful food for myself and my family
  
Doing this much more &#8211; now I go to the Starbucks at the other end of town (it&#8217;s a little town) which shares the parking lot with a nice little market, so I can buy stuff in the morning to make for dinner. That works out very well. Tomorrow we (myself and the kids) will go to the farmer&#8217;s market after our martial arts classes.
  
&#8211; Attend at least 3 martial arts classes a week
  
Check! So far I&#8217;m doing great with this. This week I&#8217;ve been every day (M-Th) and I plan to go tonight and tomorrow as well. My running suffers when I focus on Martial Arts but there&#8217;s a tournament next weekend and I&#8217;m competing in the forms division and I don&#8217;t want to suck!
  
&#8211; Go back to pre-planning at least 48 hours ahead anything that causes me stress (girl scouts, get-togethers, anything where my tummy wrenches when I think about it)
  
I&#8217;m a little better at this. And thank heavens, the other moms in the girl scout troop pretty much took it over when Susan got hurt so that I could focus on helping her and her family&#8230; I did get somewhat depressed but am back on wellbutrin and doing much better now! Talk about TMI, eh?
  
&#8211; Move myself closer to zen mastery
  
Uh, not yet. Maybe I can work on that during the summer ðŸ™‚
  
Pretty good, actually! Not bad considering I completely forgot that I had these goals at all.
  
2. Whatâ€™s your favorite board game?
  
Scrabble! I love Scrabble! I play once a week with a co-worker at lunchtime and he usually kicks my ass. But it&#8217;s fun!
  
3. Youâ€™re a relatively new knitter, so whatâ€™s your favorite yarn so far?
  
Hmm&#8230; I really liked working with the tape yarn to make Sherbet, and this self-striping sock yarn is fab, but I&#8217;m most looking forward to working with the Fiesta La Luz silk yarn that I got at Stitches West.
  
4. Create a fabulous pretend meal for me (and feel free to provide recipes if you want!).
  
Since I don&#8217;t know what you like, I&#8217;ll just cook what \*I\* like, and I&#8217;m in the mood for comfort food right now ðŸ™‚
  
Stir fried sugar snow peas (from How To Cook Everything by Mark Bittleman)
  
Caesar salad with candied pecans and bleu cheese
  
[Chicken with pan gravy and cornmeal dumplings](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/104633?epiSearchPage=http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/find/results?search=cornmeal+dumpling+chicken&x=0&y=0) (one of my favorite main meals, I love this recipe)
  
Maple-ginger creme brulee
  
That should do it ðŸ™‚
  
5. Whatâ€™s the next project you will cast on?
  
It&#8217;ll definitely be something for Susan. Either a scarf or wrist warmers with the Manos Cotton Stria I got, or possibly the Hallowig from Knitty in the Fiesta La Luz. I think that&#8217;ll be just adorable!
