OSCON has always had a big kickoff event on Tuesday night, to get everyone ready before the keynotes and sessions get started on Wednesday. &nbsp;Last night they used this time to present their first ever Ignite event, and it was excellent &#8211; one of the most engaging and fun kickoff events I&#8217;ve seen at an OSCON.

  The <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/07/tonights-ignite-oscon-line-up.html">lineup</a> was varied, and the topics were refreshingly diverse. &nbsp;Jet packs and Nigerian elections, Kindle hacking and film ratings &#8211; the combination kept the audience engaged, and entertained. &nbsp;The presenters did an excellent job of staying within the ignite format (20 slides,15 seconds each slide, advanced automatically, 5 minutes total). &nbsp;

  Jesse gave the first talk, which was the most technical. &nbsp;It&#8217;s amazing to think of the Kindle as a platform that can be hacked &#8211; for anyone interested in the topic, I have a feeling Jesse will be happy to talk to folks during the rest of the conference. &nbsp;You can play the old adventure game on his kindle &#8211; although I couldn&#8217;t remember how to get into the house. &nbsp;

  Skud followed with an entertaining glance into the world of textiles, and Liz Henry gave a truly inspiring talk about wheelchairs as hackable vehicles (as opposed to boring medical devices).&nbsp;

  Julian Cash&#8217;s overview of his photography was, as always, incredible. &nbsp;He is doing more OSCON pictures this year, in room G, so stop by and get a portrait done with him. &nbsp;His perspective and artistry add so much to our community, and he is a wonderful person to talk to as well.

  Sandy Jen&#8217;s discussion of the Open Source used at Meebo was very entertaining &#8211; Open Source is such a great idea in theory (and in practice, once you work out the kinks). &nbsp;The space between the theory and the practice is frequently fraught with amusing stories, and she told hers well.

  I was hugely inspired by <a href="http://www.mrmeyer.com/">Dan Meyer&#8217;s</a> ideas about open sourcing his teaching methods. &nbsp;I have long been interested in enabling shared knowledge among teachers, and I will definitely be following his work to see where I can contribute.

  I was fascinated by Selena Deckleman&#8217;s story of the election work she did in Nigeria, and hugely entertained by Erica Olsen&#8217;s suggested movie rating system. &nbsp;I also feel it&#8217;s necessary to know if I&#8217;m watching a movie with a Xenu-inspired script. &nbsp;

  Damian, of course, was hilarious (as he always is). &nbsp;And he actually stayed within the 5 minutes, which I think is some sort of new record.

  A great evening, and great job by the OSCON team!
