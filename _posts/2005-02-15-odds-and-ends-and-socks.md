Odds and Ends #1: I fear I have been a horribly ungrateful Secret Pal recipient. When I detailed the niftiness that was my Secret Pal Package I neglected possibly the coolest thing &#8211; some adorable stitch markers made, I believe, from earrings. She even mentioned them in her helpful note but being the airhead I am, I missed the mention entirely and didn&#8217;t see the markers until I dove into the candy this morning:

Aren&#8217;t those cool? Thanks again, SP! And especially thanks for not saying something like \*Ahem\*, did you actually read my note?
  
Odds and Ends #2: A couple of months ago I taught my friend (the one in the ICU) to knit. She promptly started on a scarf but found herself short yarn to make the length she wanted. She intended to get herself another ball, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if she&#8217;d succeeded, so while I was on my whirlwind Yarn Tour I got another ball for her. She&#8217;ll be getting better enough to need some entertainment soon, I have faith:

Socks: OK, this time for sure. I have cast on for these socks 6 times. First, I used some Bamboo DPN&#8217;s with Lorna&#8217;s Laces. After 3 tries, I was unable to create anything but a fuzzy amorphous blob. I did what any good knitter would do. I blamed the splittiness of Lorna&#8217;s Laces and the snagginess of the Bamboo DPNs. So I got some more sock yarn and DPNs (see Sunday&#8217;s post for the gory details) and cast on my lovely Lantern Moon DPNs with Lana Grossa yarn and a new pattern. Not splitty, not snaggy. And yet it took me \*3\* more tries to get something remotely resembling a rib for the top. I felt so fumbly and klutzy trying to wrangle the triangle. But I think I&#8217;m getting the hang of it! Look, it even looks kinda socky!

I am aware that I have yet to get to the fun heel turn but please don&#8217;t harsh my buzz right now. The ribs look ribby, the stripes are cute, I have finally made some progress on the Sock. I am no longer a SockTard. I now have 6 inches of fascinating stockinette stitch before the next exciting section of the sock. Perfect timing, too, we have Desperate Housewives on the Tivo!
