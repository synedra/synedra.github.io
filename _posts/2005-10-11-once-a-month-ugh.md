Yes, it&#8217;s true&#8230; \*sigh\* I&#8217;ve become one of those once-a-month-whether-I-need-it-or-not bloggers. Alas. I don&#8217;t even have any new excuses &#8211; entropy and chaos have had me in their inescapable grasp for most of 2005. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel! It looks like I may be heading into a calmer 2006&#8230;
  
In any case, here&#8217;s my update on all the recent chaos in my life. I&#8217;ve already discussed the selling of the house and moving across the county, so I&#8217;m gonna have to come up with some new interesting topics to keep my readers awake.
  
**Cheerleading**: I know, it&#8217;s not really new. But driving V back and forth to practices and games eats up a lot of my time, so it&#8217;s worth mentioning. Plus the only picture I have available for this entry is Victoria cheering. This weekend we had a game on Saturday (we won) and a cheer competition on Sunday (the girls came in 3rd out of 16, and I am so proud of all of them!)

**Job**: I believe I mentioned that I was looking for a new job, and I am happy to report that as of Monday I will be spending my geeky working hours in the service of [SocialText](http://www.socialtext.com/). It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity to work with some of the smartest folks in my particular geeky industry and I&#8217;m really excited.
  
**School**: Yet again, the boy was having some issues with the kids&#8217; school. So we moved them to a [new school](http://www.aptosacademy.com/), 5 minutes from our house, and we&#8217;re thrilled with the change. For those of you familiar with the D&D millieu, the school we had them at before was heavy into &#8216;Law&#8217; &#8211; These Are The Rules and now Let&#8217;s Apply Them. My boy was in the office every day for a new transgression and seriously stressed all the time. The new school is, I would say, solidly Chaotic Good. Each kid has their own learning plan and goals, and they are very adaptable &#8211; my boy is thriving, as is my girl. Did I mention thrilled? Oh, and for those of you who understand the Law/Chaos division and need somewhere to waste valuable time, please check out [Order of the Stick](http://www.giantitp.com/cgi-bin/GiantITP/ootscript?SK=1). Go on, I&#8217;ll wait.
  
**Susan**: No, she&#8217;s not chaotic ðŸ™‚ I just wanted to update anyone interested and tell you all that she&#8217;s doing great! She&#8217;s learning to walk again, working a couple days a week, and really looking and feeling like a regular person again.
