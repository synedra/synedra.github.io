This morning was beyond annoying as I dealt with some lousy customer service people, but the day is looking up now&#8230; and I got some sponsors from work and [Danielle](http://poeticpurl.blogspot.com/) as well, so my Revlon total is looking better too&#8230;
  
I got another cool package from my knitty secret pal yesterday! A cool book on sweaters, some rowan calmer and a velvety bag which is so soft and fuzzy that I can&#8217;t stop petting it. I love it all!

And&#8230; and&#8230; and&#8230; yes, the moebius is done! It&#8217;s much much longer than I expected but it can be wrapped around the neck and still drape down to a decent scarf length. Or you can wrap it twice and have 3 different levels. It&#8217;s darn cool either way.

I did not yet order (and thus did not yet receive) the 60&#8243; needles I need for the kitty bed, so I think I will cast on for Susan&#8217;s silk hallowig next. Can&#8217;t wait to see how that comes out. I only have one skein so I think I&#8217;ll knit it on big needles so it&#8217;s more open (and so the skein makes it to the end).
