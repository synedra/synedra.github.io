Made some tamale pie today and it came out wonderfully, rave reviews all around
  
2 pounds of ground meat (turkey, beef, whatever you like)
  
1 tbsp onion powder
  
1 tbsp of chili powder
  
1 tbsp cumin powder
  
1 tbsp smushed or chopped garlic
  
1 package of trader joe&#8217;s frozen roasted corn (or regular corn is fine too)
  
1 8 oz can of tomato sauce
  
1 16 ounce can of seasoned chopped tomatoes
  
1 can of green chilis
  
4 oz red wine
  
1 can of cream-style corn
  
1 package of trader joe&#8217;s cornbread mix
  
1/4 cup milk
  
1 1/2 cups grated Cheddar
  
1 medium package of Frito corn chips
  
Fry the ground meat up with the seasonings until it&#8217;s browned. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, corn, chilis, and wine to the meat and simmer for 20 minutes.
  
While it&#8217;s simmering, mix the cream style corn with the cornbread mix. Add 1/2 cup of the cheese and enough milk to make it runny (about 1/4 cup). Crush the fritos and combine them with the remaining cup of cheese.
  
When the meat is ready spread it out over the bottom of your casserole dish or 9&#215;11 baking pan. Spread the cornbread mix across the top, reaching all the way to the edges. Cook at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, then sprinkle the frito cheese mixture over the top and put the dish back in the oven for another 10 minutes.
