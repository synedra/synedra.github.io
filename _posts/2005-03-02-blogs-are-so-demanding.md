My darned blog template only looks lovely when I actually, you know, \*post\* every now and then. How rude!
  
Well, that&#8217;s ok. I have stuff to show. I wanted to finish my first sockapalooza sock before I posted and I&#8217;m getting close. Look! It looked even better on my daughter&#8217;s foot, her foot is much closer to that of my pal, but I had to have something to show so here is the size 8 sock on my size 11 behemoth foot.

I have learned many valuable lessons about making socks:

  * Stockinette stitch is pretty dull 
      * It&#8217;s even dull when you switch off continental/american 
          * &#8230; but stripy yarn does help. 
              * Bamboo needles are kinda fragile, especially when you try to tug a small sock onto a big foot. Sometimes they break. Which sucks. And snags your yarn. Plus it&#8217;s kind of embarrassing. 
                  * Turning a heel isn&#8217;t very hard, as long as you just turn off your brain and follow the directions. 
                      * I like gussets. Who woulda thunk? </ul> 
                        I can&#8217;t wait until these are done (and something for Susan) so I can start on a pair of socks for MEEEEE! I have some koigu just waiting to be made into some lovely socks.
  
                        I also have a lovely photo of Sherbet&#8217;s new owner:

                        What? Why are you still pointing that camera at me? I did cute for the \*last\* picture!

                        As you can see, fortune smiled on this new knitter and the sweater fits perfectly. I only hope she doesn&#8217;t eat any of the buttons!
