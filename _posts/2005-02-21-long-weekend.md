I would hope that with a long weekend I&#8217;d get lots of time to knit. Hah! I seem to have contracted an annoying cold so I had lots of time to sleep, instead. Oh well. I did get my hair straightened on Thursday, it&#8217;s pretty darned cute now. You can see my previous funky hair in this fabulously flattering picture from the race pics on my [fitness blog](http://fitness.domestigirl.com/). And another with it nice and straight:

&#8230; which makes me happy. Yes, I am aware that some people use &#8220;blow dryers&#8221; and other new age equipment to make their hair behave in this way, but I do not have time for this kind of nonsense. It&#8217;s a lucky day when my hair meets a brush on the way out the door. So this hairstyle is great for me.
  
I swore to [Michelle](http://fickleknitterfiend.blogspot.com) that I would not post a picture of my sock before turning the heel. I lied. Man, there are a \*lot\* of rows of stockinette. I know you&#8217;re all on the edge of your seats hoping to see the tubey top of a sock, so I won&#8217;t disappoint my adoring fans. Look, I even photographed it at a jaunty angle to conceal the dullness of the progress&#8230;

Next time you see it, it will have a shaped heel!
  
Moving on&#8230; my next project (which may sneak in before I&#8217;m done with my socks) will be with this luscious yarn:

It&#8217;s Fiesta Yarns, 100% Silk Chenille, in the Poppies colorway. I got it for $20 at Stitches West. Had no idea what a great score it was until I looked it up when I got home &#8211; it goes for $40/skein normally&#8230; It feels even more fabulous than it looks.
  
Anyhow, what does one \*do\* with a $20 hank of yarn? Well, actually, I plan to do something very [silly](http://knitty.com/ISSUEfall04/PATThallowig.html) with it. Since my friend has some stitches on her head, I&#8217;m going to knit her a silk hairstyle that she can wear when she wants, until her hair grows in. It should feel and look fabulous. I&#8217;ll be sure to take pictures of it before gifting it to her.
