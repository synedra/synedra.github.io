Well, I had a post all ready to go and my browser took a dive, hmph. Ah well. Second time&#8217;s the charm, I guess!
  
Still working hard on my moebius thing, so I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to thank those wonderful folks who have already sponsored me for the Revlon Run/Walk. Many thanks to [Lu](http://knit4ever.blogspot.com), [Michelle](http://www.fickleknitter.com) and [Kathy](http://minxknits.blog-city.com)! I&#8217;m up to $40 now which is very exciting ðŸ™‚
  
I&#8217;m now going to whet your appetites with some lovely fiber porn, hoping to entice even more of you to contribute. As I said, the winners of this raffle will get to pick the type of prize they want (spinning, knitting, books, sweet treats) &#8211; or take the &#8216;surprise me&#8217; option.
  
Today I&#8217;m going to talk about the spinning option! When I was at Stitches West I got some great roving and a spindle, but haven&#8217;t had time to work on my spinning. It seems a shame that this fabulous roving isn&#8217;t being fondled regularly by anyone, so I&#8217;ll be happy to pass it along to a lucky winner.
  
The Spinning Prize will include:
  
(1) nice wooden drop spindle and (1) brochure with spinning instructions

(1) hank of merino/tencel roving from [Deep Color](http://www.deepcolorstudio.com). I can&#8217;t even begin to describe how incredibly yummy this stuff feels and looks. I&#8217;ve heard that it spins up just like butter and I can totally believe it. Seriously, look me straight in the eye and tell me these photos don&#8217;t start your salivary glands up.
  
You can pick either of the two colors I have:
  
purple&#8230;

or teal&#8230;

here&#8217;s the money shot with both of them

So come on! Who could possibly resist all that shimmery wool, intertwined together on the floor? [Sponsor me](https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/la/secure/myWebPage.cfm?pID=232938) and win some yummy roving&#8230;
  
I&#8217;ll leave you with some random thoughts for those folks finding me through interesting search engine searches:
  
For those of you searching on &#8216;koigu clapotis&#8217; and &#8216;clapotis fingering&#8217;, let me just warn you that many a knitter has run out of steam about 2/3 of the way through when using teeny tiny yarn. On the other hand I&#8217;ve seen some [incredibly beautiful ones](http://wonderwoman.typepad.com/nice_knits/2005/04/finally_fini.html) so it&#8217;s up to you. I haven&#8217;t started mine yet&#8230;
  
Whoever searched on &#8216;SUSHI +WASHCLOTH -EAT -RICE +CUTE&#8217; I&#8217;m pretty certain you didn&#8217;t find what you were looking for here. I hope you found your cute sushi washcloths somewhere! I&#8217;d like to see those, actually.
  
&#8216;silk & seagrass drawstring box&#8217; and &#8216;lantern moon drawstring box&#8217; &#8211; yes, I have one of those!

And, strangely, someone found me by searching on &#8216;grumpy&#8217;. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m that grumpy, do you?
