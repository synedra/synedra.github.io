This has been a good day.
  
I have had a very stressful couple of weeks, which has been compounded by the fact that I apparently forgot that I turn into a raving lunatic when I don&#8217;t exercise. Sometimes I fear that I am not very bright. Finally, this morning, I took a long, hard look at myself and realized that I might stop flapping my arms and squaking like a rabid chicken if I moved my body around. So I went running. And I felt a lot better. And tonight I went to martial arts, and felt even better. And my wonderful husband went and dealt with my martial arts school issue, which was a huge load off of my mind. I think I&#8217;ll keep him&#8230;
  
Also, I made a to-do list and moved a lot of things to the &#8216;done&#8217; category. Plus the remaining list looks manageable. It&#8217;s really not that bad. Not even the &#8216;work&#8217; part. The &#8216;non-work&#8217; item I&#8217;m looking most forward to is finding good prizes for the raffle winners. I really love trying to match stuff to people, and I&#8217;m hoping to get all the goodies in the mail tomorrow. And I feel so good having raised this money, I&#8217;m glad to give some of you a little something to thank you for participating with me!
  
My co-worker is finally back from vacation so I went to lunch with him, which was fun. He allows me to babble non-stop (most people roll their eyes, but he just looks amused and waits until I&#8217;m out of breath before he tries to talk). Plus I got some much-needed perspective by talking to a homeless person while Erik (my co-worker) ran into the deli to buy him a sandwich. Erik&#8217;s a good guy. I&#8217;m proud to know him. Don&#8217;t tell him I said so, though. His head is already fairly swollen, especially on the days when he kicks my ass at Scrabble.
  
And now that my to-do list looks more manageable I can get back to knitting on those poor neglected socks. And cast on for the kitty bed. And my summer tank. What the heck, I might even get that one DONE before the summer is out. The J4M KAL may be just what I need, an excuse to spoil myself for a little while and stop feeling like the world will stop spinning if I take the time to soak myself in the tub&#8230; or knit for a while just because I want to. Apparently the world doesn&#8217;t require that I race around non-stop without stopping to smell the roses. Thank goodness.
  
It looks like Susan will be coming home this week. She&#8217;s been doing so well in rehab, I&#8217;m so proud of her.
  
All of the electronic equipment in my office (hardware VPN router, wireless router, network backup drive&#8230;) is working correctly and flawlessly. Of course, my office \*does\* need a tiny bit of tidying but it&#8217;s on my list! Also the order for my new Powerbook went in today, so I&#8217;ll have a new computer sometime next week.
  
Oh wait, I forgot to mention&#8230; I FOUND the lost yarn!
  
Like I said, a Very Good Day. Tomorrow there will be pictures. Of something.
  
Good night, all.
