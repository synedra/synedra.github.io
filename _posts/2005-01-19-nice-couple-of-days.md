Tuesday: Martial Arts, 90 minutes
  
Wednesday: Martial Arts class: 45 minutes
  
It feels like I&#8217;m getting into a good rhythm here, getting back in the habit of making the time to get exercise in. Martial arts class over the last two days, good workouts, and I&#8217;m eating lots less. Tomorrow, more running!
  
For anyone out there planning to get started on a new program, I highly recommend getting a good book on heart zone training so you can increase your fitness level gradually and without stressing your body too much. A great book is [Fit and Fat](http://www.powells.com/search/DTSearch/search?partner_id=29171&cgi=search/search/&searchtype=kw&searchfor=fat%20fit%20sally%20edwards) by Sally Edwards&#8230; check it out. I need to get a copy for myself &#8211; I&#8217;m implementing a strict book allowance starting on Friday so I need to buy all my books now!
  
And while I&#8217;m on a buying spree, I&#8217;m having a hard time resisting getting one of the new [GPS Heart rate monitor things](http://www.heartmonitors.com/timex/timex_body_link_heart_rate_data_recorder.htm). But they&#8217;re really expensive and don&#8217;t track calories. For now I&#8217;ll stick with my Polar M51, which tracks calories, heart rate, all the useful stuff. Maybe when it warms up and I run outside more I&#8217;ll want the GPS tracker.
  
Got some excellent news today &#8211; I get to be in another Field beta test for Nike shoes &#8211; sometimes it&#8217;s nice to have size 12 feet. Looking forward to playing in another butt-ugly pair of test shoes, for sure&#8230;
