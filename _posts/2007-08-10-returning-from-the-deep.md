Once upon a time, I had a knitting/mom/cooking blog, which is still hanging around [here](http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog) but, as you can see, it has been sadly neglected since I started working at [Socialtext](http://www.socialtext.com). One reason for that is that I spent a lot of my blogging energy blogging on our internal wiki (and eventually I blogged on our externally visible [Open](http://www.socialtext.net/open/index.cgi?action=weblog_display&category=Kirsten%27s+Weblog) workspace&#8230; but the time has come for me to leave Socialtext and so I&#8217;m starting up my personal blog again.
  
This is going to be a &#8220;Kirsten&#8221; blog, filled with whatever I&#8217;m thinking about at the time. People who know me can tell you that&#8217;s a fairly wide swath of everything there is in the world&#8230;
