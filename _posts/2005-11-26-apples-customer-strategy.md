First of all, I think I should mention that I re-combined my blogs (cooking, fitness, and domestigirl) into a single blog. Also, I&#8217;m going to stop trying to stick closely to knitting content. This is a Kirsten blog and I am a geek, so periodically there will be geek content. Sometimes I will post photos of random things I find interesting. And heaven knows there&#8217;s a fairly high percentage chance that I&#8217;ll find some other new hobby that I feel the need to discuss. However, I get that lots of the people who happen by here aren&#8217;t that interested in geeky content, so I promise to try to do a good job of categorizing my content, and I have created RSS feeds for each of the categories on my blog &#8211; they&#8217;re accessable over there <<< in the left sidebar. So now that I have a new "Geek Stuff" Category, I need to rant a bit about the problems inherent in owning a Macintosh. I have one because my work is largely unix-based (told you I was a geek) and, really... prepare yourself... I hate Microsoft. I know, I know, it's a tired old sentiment, but I do love my mac and it does all the stuff I want. But sometimes, just sometimes, I get a yearning to do something \*outside\* of the sterile, bounded environment defined by the offerings of the Apple Store. For instance, last week I found myself at a customer site in New York. Being a Wall Street Investment Bank, they were fairly protective of their internal network. I was allowed to use one of \*their\* systems, on \*their\* network, and not install any additional software. Since our team communicates largely via IRC and Skype, this put me in a difficult position - I couldn't get a network connection for my system, and I couldn't use their system to communicate. So, I need to find a way to use the cellular system to communicate, either on my computer or using a handheld. After an extensive amount of research (too much, as is my normal habit) I determined that I had 2 options: 

  1. A Blackberry Handheld. The Treo, while more full functioned, is much more likely to die if I drop it. Based on previous experience with my cell phones, this means that I would probably have a single trouble-free month with the phone before a clumsy moment rendered it useless.</p> 
      * A Cellular Card for my computer </ol> 
        If I get a Blackberry, I can: 
        
          * &#8230; sync it with my mac if I buy [PocketMac](http://www.pocketmac.net/products/pmblackberry/) 
              * Install [IRC software](http://jmirc.sourceforge.net/faq.html) on it to stay in touch with my team (only works with the BlackBerry 7230, 7280) 
                  * I can&#8217;t use it as a modem for my macintosh, though </ul> 
                    If I get a PC Card:
                    
                      * I have found a [company in Germany](http://www.novamedia.de/e_pages/e_produkte_mac_mhs.html) which makes some software to make it work on a Mac. Of course it won&#8217;t be supported by my cellular service &#8211; in fact when I called to ask if the configuration would work the woman wasn&#8217;t sure what I meant by &#8216;macintosh&#8217;. &#8220;Does it have a PC slot? Can it do wireless? Then it&#8217;ll work!&#8221; OK, sure. </ul> 
                        So it turns out that either one can be made to work. And since I&#8217;m a geek-with-a-mac, neither will take me much time to get working now that I&#8217;ve invested 3 hours in finding out how to do so. But I ask you, what kind of strategy is this for Apple? They&#8217;re trying to target their systems to neophyte computer users, making them more accessable and less threatening. It seems like they might want to try to make it a little easier to do something like setting up a cellular modem on my system since most of their users wouldn&#8217;t even know where to start looking.
  
                        I&#8217;m heartened by Apple&#8217;s recent forays into partnerships with different technologies&#8230; their Itunes agreements have given me hope that they&#8217;ll start looking into other similar possibilities. It&#8217;ll be very cool when I look at adding some new functionality to my life and find that it &#8216;just works&#8217; with the system I love so dearly.
  
                        Until then, I&#8217;ll just keep on googling to find the configuration answers to the puzzles, and sharing them here so I don&#8217;t forget where they are.
  
                        For now, I just need to figure out if I need to decide if I can do enough of my work on the blackberry or if I&#8217;d rather be able to connect my Mac anywhere.
