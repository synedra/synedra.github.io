I need to learn Flex so that I can throw together a demo of an application in the next couple of weeks. I know what I need to do, some other kind soul has done the programming and even published the source for the hardest element in the application, so I just need to ramp up on the language so I can take that code and run with it.
  
Being a research queen, I headed over to Amazon to look at the reviews for Flex books. I read all of them and decided on [Programming Flex 2](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Flex-comprehensive-creating-applications/dp/059652689X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5921026-3072023?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1191279022&sr=8-1)&#8230; forgetting, apparently, that I have the attention span of a gnat and so a conceptual programming book is doomed to fail to teach me something new.
  
I did make it through 100 pages before MEGO (My Eyes Glaze Over) set in and I stopped being able to understand any of the words on the page. I shook the cobwebs out of my head and went back to Amazon and discovered that I probably wanted [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Guide-Flex-ActionScript-3-0/dp/1590597338/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/002-5921026-3072023?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1191279022&sr=8-3) instead, since it&#8217;s in a tutorial format instead of the bone-dry lecture format of the other one. I was going to head down to Borders to get it, but my daughter called to be picked up from school so I didn&#8217;t get the chance.
  
Having returned home, I hunted for reasonable online FlexBuilder tutorials and found that Adobe actually has some really good tutorials in their documentation. Turns out that there&#8217;s also a [special deal](http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mchotin/archives/2007/09/30_days_of_free.cfm) with their training provider for 30 days free, so I signed up for that. In fact, these two training courses map almost exactly to the book I didn&#8217;t end up buying and I&#8217;m probably going to get more out of an online presentation.
  
So, having read 5 chapters/100 pages of a perfectly good reference book in 3 hours this morning, I had a vague understanding of the overall application and how it worked, but no idea at all how to do anything in the application. Doing 11 tutorials later in the day (about 2 hours) got me much closer to where I want to be &#8211; I finally said &#8220;uncle&#8221; when my brains started dribbling out of my ears. I plan to spend the next couple of days doing more tutorials and then I think I&#8217;ll have more than enough experience to do what I need to do. Heck, a goodly part of my job is going to be making prototypes &#8211; I might as well learn this one really well before trying out OpenLaszlo.
  
What did I learn? O&#8217;Reilly makes really good reference books, but I just can&#8217;t learn from them. I need someone to tell me how to do various things and I&#8217;ll pick up all of the intricacies from that. I&#8217;m good at identifying when my kids aren&#8217;t learning something with a particular method, but it&#8217;s harder to remember that I have the same limitations. On the other hand, the O&#8217;Reilly book will be a good reference, so it wasn&#8217;t a waste of money.
