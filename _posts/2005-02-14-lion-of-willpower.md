My friend [Lyssa](http://recklesscraft.blogspot.com) called me the Lion of Willpower, referring to my behavior while we were at Stitches West on Sunday. Methinks she might be engaging in a tiny bit of sarcasm. I started off well enough, petting (but not buying) the irresistable Lobster Pot cashmere and Honey Hill Alpaca, along with all the other fabulously soft and expensive yarns. Oh, no, I don&#8217;t need more yarn. I&#8217;m good! I have many projects to do, and the yarn to do them with. I bought enough stuff when I was here Friday, I don&#8217;t need to buy anything today. Really.
  
But flashing in the back of my head was this image of [Michelle](http://fickleknitterfiend.blogspot.com) sitting on my couch and casting on for her [Clapotis](http://fickleknitterfiend.blogspot.com/2005/02/it-had-to-be-ewe.html). I had a little whispering voice stuck in my head like a song you can&#8217;t shake&#8230; &#8220;Clapotis, clapotis, clapotis&#8221; the whole time I was wandering the aisles of the marketplace. There were these wonderful colorways at the [Hand Jive](http://www.handjiveknits.com/index.html) booth. I love the Nature&#8217;s Palette yarn. I will own some soon. It would make a nice clapotis. But no! I am good! I do not. Need. More. Yarn. (clapotis, clapotis, clapotis) No, no, no!
  
We were almost through our first circuit, the marketplace was closing soon, so I went ahead and opened my wallet to buy some more roving. Yes, I know, I&#8217;m not very good at spinning yet. I am hoping I might get my friend to give me a lesson at spinning on a &#8220;real&#8221; wheel. Pretty harmless, one 4-oz ball of roving&#8230; well, maybe two. They&#8217;re so pretty&#8230;

&#8230; once I opened my wallet, the floodgates were opened, but I still figured I was safe. After all, the marketplace closed in 15 minutes, how much trouble could I get in? Lyssa wanted to go check out some more of the cool needles near the Nature&#8217;s Palette yarn so we headed back there&#8230; and on the way I happened to see some Koigu. In my favorite colors. For $11/skein. I wrested myself away and went over to pet the Nature&#8217;s Palette. I found several colorways that I liked. But they were all \*just\* short of having enough for, you know, that project. (clapotis, clapotis, clapotis) I thought&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t know what I thought. I suspect I was beyond conscious thought at that time. The Koigu was calling me, from 4 aisles away. I don&#8217;t remember crossing those aisles but then there I was, standing in line, Koigu in hand.
  
Koigu. It&#8217;s hip, it&#8217;s now. It&#8217;s happening. A Clapotis in Koigu, well, you can hardly get more trendy than that. I will be the coolest knitter in blogland.

Yup, tower of iron will, thy name is DomestiGirl!
  
On our last quick pass through, I noticed that Cat Bordhi was signing her books at the Knitters Studio booth. She is cool. Her books are cool. I had to get them because of the jester&#8217;s bag (which you can also wear on your head!) I own them both now and they are both signed.

In one of her notes to me she said I had a great laugh. How could I not laugh after hearing the Mistress of Moebius telling me that the Fanny Basket was more properly named the Moebi-Ass (pictured here, lower left hand corner)

So maybe I&#8217;m not the Lion of Willpower. But I sure have some great new stuff! My Secret Pal sent me an excellent package but it deserves its own entry, so I&#8217;ll do that one in the morning.
