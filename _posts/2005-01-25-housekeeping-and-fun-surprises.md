<editorial note>I&#8217;ve moved all my cooking stuff to a separate blog named [DomestiGirl Cooks!](http://cook.domestigirl.com) Head over there to see my recipes and food musings</editorial note>
  
Back to knitting! Yesterday our postal carrier was running very late and didn&#8217;t come until dark, so I was pleasantly surprised while making dinner when a package appeared on my doorstep from my [Knitty Secret Pal!](http://www.knittyboard.com/viewtopic.php?t=2061&start=345)

What cool stuff!

  * A cool socky variegated ball of yarn to make some Sockapalooza socks with (she promises they won&#8217;t be itchy!) The great thing is that these autumn colors are just what my sockapalooza pal likes. 
      * A nice cotton chenille with a pattern for an interesting dishcloth! No more boring stockinette stitch dishcloths! 
          * An adorable pad of kitty note paper (aw) 
              * Seeds from her garden, for mine &#8211; lots of cool seeds (including chenille ðŸ™‚ mostly ones which love full sun. Which is a Very Good Thing considering my house sits perched atop a very very sunny hill. And I was just contemplating getting some more flowers out in my yard, so the timing is great&#8230; 
                  * A very cool little soap. I can&#8217;t place the scent but it&#8217;s really very yummy. Smells almost like some of my Perfumer&#8217;s Apprentice scents. Mmmm&#8230;. </ul> 
                    Thanks, Secret Pal! You&#8217;re the best!
