Wow, I am a super-flaky fitness blogger. It looks like I haven&#8217;t done anything, and yet I have!
  
Last week, I went to martial arts Tuesday and Wednesday, and then had belt testing on Thursday which was pretty intense. Then I sat around like a big old slug for F/S/S (was going to run with Amy on Sunday but it rained, boo hiss).
  
Today, I&#8217;m back to running! I can&#8217;t go to martial arts tonight so I ran 2 miles and I&#8217;m happy to report that it was \*fun\*. No, really! Fun. Not terribly fast but I&#8217;ll take it&#8230; I want to try to start getting in a run every other day regardless of martial arts. Especially in this season of Girl Scout cookies, it is very important!
