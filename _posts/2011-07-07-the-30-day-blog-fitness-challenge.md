Inspired by my coworkers, I&#8217;m going to participate in the [30 Day Blog Fitness Challenge](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2011/07/30-day-blog-fitness-challenge.html). Â In contemplating it, though, I want to add a little bit of extra interest for myself, and remind myself of the value of taxonomy and categorization. Â I used to post about all sorts of things, and I find that I stick to work-related things mostly. Â Why? I don&#8217;t know. Â I mean, there are categories. I can use them. Â People can find what they need! Â But recently I&#8217;ve become super lazy and avoided any sort of tagging, just tossing things willy nilly onto the blog, and focusing mostly on work related topics. Â Add to this the fact that I&#8217;ve just joined Google+ and I find myself categorizing my people into circles which I&#8217;m not exactly confident about. Â Are they the right circles? Â Do I need more (or less)? Â Am I ever going to send messages to that group?

So not only am I going to post every day for 30 days (or more), I&#8217;m going to put meaningful categories on the blog posts. Â And then I&#8217;m going to post to (and list) the Google+ Circles I&#8217;m sharing that post with. Â This should actually help me get better at creating and maintaining meaningful circles for the things I want to talk about. Â Fitness, entertainment, work, open source, philosophy&#8230; there is space for all of this and more in my thoughts and in my blog, but if I am talking to a specific set of people I&#8217;ve identified in Google+ as interested in the topic it may help focus the message and make it more compelling and engaging. Â Otherwise I seem to soften it a bit for the general masses.

So prepare for 30 days of posts about&#8230; whatever. Â Adventure racing. Â Google Plus itself. Â The Semantic Web. Â Food. Â I&#8217;ll tell you what the names of the circles I&#8217;m sharing them with are. Â And they&#8217;ll be internally categorized reasonably on the blog.

Anyone else want to join me on this? Â I think this will be an excellent test of those circles we&#8217;ve been making. Â Are there topics that are appropriate for one or two of your circles? If not, maybe you need to adjust them? Â What is the purpose of circles unless they help you target specific conversations to the right people?

This post be sent as public on G+. Â It&#8217;s not a copout. Â Seriously ðŸ™‚
