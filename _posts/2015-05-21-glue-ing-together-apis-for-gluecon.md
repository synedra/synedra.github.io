Last year, at Defrag, I made my IoT rube goldberg machine made up of a sphero, hue lightbulb, raspberry pi and my drone. Â I might have accidentally almost attacked the audience with the drone. Â But it was a success and entertaining for all.

This year, instead of doing that,Â I&#8217;m doing a fitness Rube Goldberg machine. Â I&#8217;m going with the carrot/stick approach to making sure that people keep up their activity. Â During the day, it checks your fitbit/myfitnesspal and sends you an SMS if you&#8217;re falling behind. Â Also, it updates the color of a Philips hue lightbulb as you advance through the day. Â If I had an IoT lock I&#8217;d unlock the freezer to get some Ben and Jerry&#8217;s ice cream as soon as I was done with my activity and protein.

This was made possible by a couple of other peoples&#8217; excellent demos, which I basically glommed together into a new thing. Â So here, for your coding pleasure, are the original repos and mine as well, so you can also nag yourself to do the right thing. Â And buy one of those lock things. Â Seriously, that seems so cool!
