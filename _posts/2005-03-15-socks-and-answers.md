Well I&#8217;ve been an absent blogger because every free minute has been consumed by trying to finish the socks on time. Unfortunately, today is the 15th and the socks didn&#8217;t go out. Yet. They&#8217;re well underway, though:

I hope to finish in a couple of days and then send them off. Yes, I know that I have to finish the toe on the first one, but I figured I&#8217;d do them at the same time.
  
My pal sent me my socks, though, and they&#8217;re wonderful!

They fit \*perfectly\*, as you can see, and they are comfortable and beautiful. I love them lots.
  
I got another couple of reciprocal interview questions, and since I know you&#8217;re all dying to know more about me I&#8217;ll answer them now:
  
La of [JenLa](http://knottygirls.com/jenlablog/index.php) asked these most excellent questions:
  
<font color="purple">1. What advice would you give a new telecommuter to keep him from going <del>entirely stir-crazy </del>the way of <em>The Shining </em>and taking his whole family with him?</font>
  
It&#8217;s hard to say. Certain people are just ok with telecommuting and other people need to interact with people. But I do interact with people. My day usually looks like this: Get up, get ready, kick the kids outta bed, go downstairs and start breakfast/lunches, check email and cases, finish getting the kids ready, take kids to school and chat a bit with the other moms, go to Starbucks for iced tea, come home, work for a couple of hours, go eat lunch with someone&#8230; you get the idea. I probably work 45-50 hours most weeks, but not all in a \*row\* so I have time to go see people. Sometimes I work from Starbucks or Borders just to scratch the &#8216;be around other people&#8217; itch. I&#8217;m super productive because I don&#8217;t go to meetings, and my boss thinks I&#8217;m great. If my kids weren&#8217;t in school and my husband didn&#8217;t have his own office I&#8217;d probably become an axe murderer.
  
<font color= purple >2. How far have you gotten on your novel? Can you give us a teaser?</font>
  
I threw the first chapter of my book in [this entry](http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/archives/2005/01/books.html). Sadly, I haven&#8217;t had the time (or made the time) to get more done. Yet.
  
<font color= purple >3. What is a lap band? Were you satisfied with your results?</font>
  
The lap band is a minimally invasive weight loss surgery. There&#8217;s lots of info about it on my [lap band site](http://www.rawbw.com/~kirsten/), but basically it&#8217;s like a little adjustable watch band around the top of your stomach making a little pouch so you get full faster. I lost over 100 pounds &#8211; I gained some of it back after I got an infection from my tummy tuck, so I&#8217;m at about 80 pounds now, but I am very satisfied with my results even so. I&#8217;m even happy with the tummy tuck but I won&#8217;t show you those before/after pictures unless you really wanna see them.
  
<font color= purple >4. What has been your favorite project thus far?</font>
  
I loved making Sherbet, that was very fun. And it looks so great on Kaily, so it was very gratifying ðŸ™‚
  
<font color= purple >5. If you could have any super-power you wanted what would it be and why?</font>
  
Well, flying of course. Does anyone ever pick anything different? I would love to be able to see the world from above.
  
And [Terby](http://www.terbyknits.blogspot.com/) asked me these questions:
  
<font color="green">1) What made you decide to do your first triathlon?</font>
  
My [friend](http://www.bumblebeefitness.com) talked me into it. I had only had my lap band for a year and was trying to really commit to consistent training. I do much better when I&#8217;m training for a goal so it worked out well. It was super fun, too ðŸ™‚
  
<font color="green">2) If you could take lessons from any chef, alive or dead, whom would you choose?</font>
  
I&#8217;d love to learn from Alton Brown. He&#8217;s such a food geek and understands the \*why\* of everything, which is fascinating to me.
  
<font color="green">3) Where would you go on your dream vacation?</font>
  
I would go back to Cozumel or Hawaii. I love diving and both places were amazingly relaxing and nice to see. I&#8217;d also love to go to New Zealand or Fiji someday.
  
<font color="green">4) What question do you wish I had asked?</font>
  
What are we doing for the kids&#8217; spring break? We&#8217;re going to Disneyland! We went when the Girl turned 2, 4, and 6&#8230; now she&#8217;s turning 8. So we have no choice, you see!
  
<font color="green">5) Egyptian theme Fry&#8217;s or Western theme? Discuss.</font>
  
I like the Egyptian theme&#8230; I&#8217;m more fond of the look, personally (love the Rosicrucian museum!) plus the layout of the other Fry&#8217;s annoys me.
