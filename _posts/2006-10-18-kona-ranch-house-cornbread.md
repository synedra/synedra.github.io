Cooks in 2 2&#8243;x11&#8243;x9&#8243; cake pans
  
5 cups bisquick
  
1-1/2 cup cornmeal
  
2 cups sugar
  
1/2 tsp nutmeg
  
1/2 tsp baking powder
  
5 sticks butter (1-1/4 pound)
  
5 eggs
  
2-1/2 cups milk
  
Combine dry ingredients and mix well. Pour melted butter or margarine over dry mixture and blend together well. Beat eggs and milk and mix with the above mixture. Blend until well mixed and not lumpy. Pour into well greased pans and cook at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes, then turn the pan 180 degrees in the oven. Reduce heat to 325 degrees and bake another 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and the center springs back when lightly touched. Poke with toothpick to check doneness.
