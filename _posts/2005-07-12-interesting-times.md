You know that good old adage &#8216;may you live in interesting times&#8217;? I think I may have taken the interesting times thing a little too far (or maybe not realized that it was a curse).
  
I had a couple of really super lousy weeks at work so I&#8217;m looking to update my resume (even though the lousiness has abated, it seems like I should have a resume which I&#8217;ve tended to in the last 5 years). And really, I should get right on that. Except that we&#8217;re, uh, moving. To a new house. Our current house is right in the middle of [this map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=scotts+valley,+ca&ll=37.042336,-122.023484&spn=0.005616,0.006207&t=k&hl=en). Our new house is [one of the eyelashes on the mighty eye of Sauron](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=la+selva+beach,+ca&ll=36.920875,-121.855288&spn=0.005616,0.006207&t=k&hl=en). We&#8217;re selling our house and renting for a while, not because of all of the great financial advice to do so &#8211; I thought of it first, they must have all been spying on me.
  
So we&#8217;re packing! And packing! And selling things on craigslist because our house has 3,500 square feet and the new one has 2,000. We&#8217;ve sold a ton of stuff which is a big rush. And now our 3,500 square foot house looks even bigger. Oh, does anyone want a washer and dryer?
  
Oh, and I&#8217;ve been burning off all my excess energy and anxiety at martial arts &#8211; I&#8217;ve started a [new one](http://www.santacruzbujinkan.com/) that I&#8217;m very fond of. Plus the main instructor is easy on the eyes, which is always helpful.
  
I have a race coming up on the 23rd, although my ability to train has been somewhat limited. I&#8217;m excited that I&#8217;m moving somewhere where I can walk to the beach in 5 minutes and drive to a great pool in 7 minutes. And the biking around my new house is totally awesome.
  
I suppose you&#8217;re wondering about knitting content. Well. Um. My yarn is packed. And my needles are packed. And my books&#8230; well, you get the idea. Hopefully I will be inspired to knit more when I move to the chilly end of town.
