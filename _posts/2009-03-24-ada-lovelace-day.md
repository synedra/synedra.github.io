Today is Ada Lovelace Day, and along with [thousands of other bloggers](http://findingada.com/), I&#8217;m going to write a little bit today about a woman I have found inspiring in the technical world.  This isn&#8217;t an easy task, picking one woman.  Like [Liz](http://liz-henry.blogspot.com/2009/03/ada-lovelace-day.html), I am blessed to personally know a huge number of inspiring geeky women, but in the spirit of the day I&#8217;m going to pick just one, who I&#8217;ve never met personally, but who has made a significant contribution to my personal success as a programmer.

  Kathy Sierra was the author of the original <a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/">Head First</a> book, and that series of books has done more for my technical progress than any other single factor.  I&#8217;m known by many people as a highly skilled programmer, but I didn&#8217;t learn that stuff in school &#8211; I have a BA in Philosophy.  I&#8217;m not good at learning from dry crusty tomes &#8211; regular programming books tend to hold my attention through about the first 3 chapters and then I&#8217;m off to try the stuff on my own.  The Head First books, of which I have 9, engage me throughout and get the needed information in my brain, so that I can dive into a programming project with the sense that I have the tools I need.

  That&#8217;s not all she&#8217;s done, though.   I saw her speak at OSCON a few years ago and was inspired to go find her blog and read it.  For the next couple of years, I read <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Creating Passionate Users</a> religiously, hoping to glean some sense of how best to engage my users and make them feel like superheroes while using my tools.

  A couple of years ago, some internet trolls crossed the line in a serious way, threatening Kathy in a way that made her feel uncomfortable about continuing to participate in the blog community.  She is still out there sharing her ideas in other ways, but I am still saddened and infuriated that anyone could do such a thing to someone who has given so much to our community and to our level of discourse.

  Kathy Sierra is my unsung hero.  Her ideas have helped me become a better programmer and a better interface designer.  Happy Ada Lovelace Day, everyone!
