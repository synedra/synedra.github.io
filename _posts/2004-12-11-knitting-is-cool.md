My friend posted in her [blog](http://fickleknitterfiend.blogspot.com) yesterday that domesticity was the New Black. Seeing this brought up a bunch of forgotten emotions left over from my teenage years, which I spent feeling like I was feverishly running in a hamster wheel, trying unsuccessfully to catch up with the Cool Kids, constantly riding the back end of every trend (I had some leg warmers which I desperately loved, but were purchased, alas, 6 months after the trend had passed).
  
So now here I am, enjoying the heck out of domesticity, and it turns out I&#8217;m in the MIDDLE of a new trend, embracing the things we mocked in our parents and grandparents. GenX folks are used to instant gratification &#8211; spend money, get what you want, but it leaves a somewhat empty feeling. On the other hand, spending several hours in the kitchen to prepare a feast, or knitting an item for a friend, feels great &#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m putting a bit of my soul in the gift I&#8217;m giving to them. While I&#8217;m in the process of making these things I&#8217;m thinking of them, and they know that with the gift, they&#8217;re getting my time and love along with it.
  
It turns out I&#8217;m not the only one&#8230; I was infected with the knitting bug over Thanksgiving Weekend (to add to my cooking passion) and then a few days later, while sitting at the doctor&#8217;s office reading [Stitch &#8216;N Bitch](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761128182/domestigirl-20), the nurse mentioned that she was a knitting fanatic herself and handed me her card. &#8220;Mobile Yarn Sales&#8221;&#8230; it read. Yikes. Like I need to have someone bring yarn to my house and feed my burgeoning addiction&#8230; and at the bottom it had my favorite line &#8220;Knitting Crisis Counselor&#8221;. Well, excellent. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll need that sometime soon.
  
My daughter and I may get to go down to the local [Stitch &#8216;n Bitch](http://www.artyoucanwear.com/stitchnbitch/) this afternoon, so we can bask in the glow of other cool knitter folks. I&#8217;m kinda bummed that I won&#8217;t be able to go to the last minute knitting party at [Knitting Arts](http://www.goknit.com/) on the 20th &#8211; my dad will be visiting and it would be rude. But it sure does sound like fun&#8230;
  
Apparently I&#8217;m part of the new domesticity. How cool is that?
