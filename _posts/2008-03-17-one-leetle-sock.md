I haven&#8217;t knitted in forever. Life just keeps getting in my way. But then a [fickle friend](http://www.fickleknitter.com/) pulled me back into the knitting world, and I figured it was ok as long as I limited myself to only one kind of knitting, so I picked socks.
  
And, since I&#8217;ve done a whole one pair of socks in my life, making me a master of the old ways, I decided to work on a [whole new way](http://www.amazon.com/New-Pathways-Sock-Knitters-Book/dp/0970886969/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1205770865&sr=8-1) of making socks&#8230; with 2 circular needles and magically weird heel turns.
  
So I started on the first practice sock. 17 times. I cast on 2 24 inch needles for this leetle sock and they got all tangled up and confused, so eventually I went down to one needle for a while until I had to go to 2, and it was generally a big old life lesson, wrapped up in a miniscule sock. My daughter asked why I was still working on this doomed socklet and I told her eventually I would finish it.
  
And so I did! I have one leetle sock! I am so looking forward to making an adult-sized pair of socks! I looked ahead in the book and realized that the socks I most want to make are the toe-up socks, which means I have to make another leetle sock, and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m up for that yet. So perhaps I&#8217;ll pick a leg-down pair to make first. Because focusing all of my knitting energy on socks means I have, um, a \*lot\* of sock yarn. And some fancy Addis I&#8217;m just itching to use.
