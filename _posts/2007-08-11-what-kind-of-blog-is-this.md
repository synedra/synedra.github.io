I looked at the posts I&#8217;d already made on the blog this morning and experienced a familiar sinking feeling, the feeling that I can&#8217;t really do blogs the way other people do.
  
One of the things I find hardest about blogging is deciding what belongs on the blog. When I had a knitting blog, I wanted to write about cooking and fitness and my family and I kept feeling like those weren&#8217;t appropriate and I&#8217;d feel terribly guilty for diluting the &#8220;good&#8221; stuff with other information, which created just enough of a barrier to writing that I ended up writing much less. And then I tried having a blog for each topic and I ended up not having any idea how to let my ideas flow, and writer&#8217;s block set in and I kinda gave up.

If I look at the blog rings and the lists and people linking to other folks, they&#8217;re generally focussed on one topic. If I were to pick an all-encompassing description for what this blog will likely be, it would be something like &#8220;The eclectic ramblings of a relatively complicated person.&#8221; I might talk about theater, or martial arts, or recipes, or open source, or collaborative software, or perl modules, or being a mom. These things are all things that are important to me, and I&#8217;m just as likely to write about any of them.
  
While I&#8217;m sure that there are three or four people who are actually interested in all of the things that I might write about, and I&#8217;m similarly aware that I can fuss with Movable Type to create sub-blogs and RSS feeds for each category (which I&#8217;ve just done), I would really love to have the ability to create different presentations for the same information, so that people who only want my fabulous recipes aren&#8217;t forced to read about perl modules, and so that I can have a different look and feel for each of them. Really different, not just &#8220;MT different.&#8221;
  
The company I work at right now ([Socialtext](http://www.socialtext.net/open)) makes software for &#8220;enterprise wikis.&#8221; You can say what you want about the idea of selling wikis into mongo corporations but I have to say we&#8217;ve done some phenomenally cool stuff&#8230; one of the things I&#8217;m most proud of is the Rest API we created. With this API you can stick things into the wiki or pull things out, and one of the coolest things I did was work with a framework on top of Socialtext to create two different faces for the same content.
  
There&#8217;s a wiki on Socialtext&#8217;s community box (you can&#8217;t see it because it&#8217;s private), but that single workspace drives the site at <http://www.perlfoundation.org> and also the blog-looking site at <http://www.perlfoundation.org/news> (which is just about done now). I did a [presentation](http://www.perlgoddess.com/Presentation.html) about our API and these websites at YAPC (which was a fairly [funny story](http://www.socialtext.net/open/index.cgi?kirsten_2007_06_27). This is cool because both of those sites are driven by the same workspace. If I post something to the workspace it shows up in both places. I could have 72 gazillion websites all using the same basic information based on how I tag it, and that&#8217;s much more to my liking.
  
With this technology it would be simple for me to present my various rambly thoughts in multiple different ways (including non-blog-looking ways)&#8230; but unfortunately the Socialtext software takes a lot of system to install and I don&#8217;t have that available. So I&#8217;ll work with Movable Type and make it behave for me so I can pretend I have several different blogs which all just happen to coexist in the same namespace.
  
I can do a lot of what I want to do with Movable Type, because they&#8217;ve got some great functionality already. I&#8217;d like to write a plugin to create a Rest API matching the Socialtext API, so that I can have full flexibility to present the information in my blog however I want.
  
In the meantime, welcome to &#8220;The eclectic ramblings of a relatively complicated person.&#8221; You can use the RSS feeds or category links to stick with a single category, or you&#8217;re welcome to read all my posts and try to figure out what the heck is going on in my wacky head. When I&#8217;m not so sleepy I&#8217;ll probably get all jiggy with the template language for MT and have different colors or something for each of the different archive types.
