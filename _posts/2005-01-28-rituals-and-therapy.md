As you might imagine, it&#8217;s been very stressful here, working through my friend&#8217;s situation. She&#8217;s undergoing surgery again right now&#8230; once they&#8217;ve got these most critical injuries resolved the orthopedic surgeon says he thinks he should be able to completely reconstruct her pelvis/hip.
  
Her boy stayed with his daddy last night so he could work on processing what&#8217;s happening, and I&#8217;ve been given the very important job of mouthpiece for the family. I set up an email list, I send out updates on her condition, and that way people don&#8217;t bug her husband on a minute-by-minute basis. It&#8217;s a good job. I feel like I&#8217;m helping in a fundamental and important way, and at the same time I selfishly appreciate the fact that I get to know \*right away\* when something happens. I&#8217;m not so good with the waiting.
  
Yesterday, she was supposed to go into surgery at 4:00. I lit some candles in the laundry room to send her some healing vibes. I chose the laundry room because the cat box is in there and the air kinda needed some candle energy too. My friend would appreciate this dual purpose candle use.
  
I didn&#8217;t find out until 8:00 that her surgery was pushed out to today, at which point my poor candles had exhausted themselves. There was no way I was blowing out my ritualistic healing candles until I knew what was up, so they just created a kinda cute flowery mosaic on the tile.

I need new candles now.
  
Just like any other nervous knitter, I&#8217;ve been using this time to work on Sherbet. The back is done. So is the front:

I&#8217;m sure I would have the whole danged thing done if I only actually paid attention to what I was doing. I swatched on 13 needles, got the gauge right, and then cast on for the back and then did the ribbing and a stripe and a half before I remembered, oh yeah, I was supposed to do the ribbing on 11s. So I ripped back and started again. Then I started a front panel. On 13s. Again, 1-1/2 stripes and d&#8217;oh! Back I ripped. The irony here is that these two were the pieces I worked on \*before\* the accident. So I have no excuse other than general air-headedness. The \*third\* panel (started on Wednesday, after the accident) I remembered the 11 needles. Apparently I do better knitting under duress.
  
Thanks for all the healing thoughts, I&#8217;m certain that they are helping. If you can, please stop by the Red Cross and give blood &#8211; my friend has needed lots of it, and will need more, and she&#8217;s not the only one. So, if you get a chance, please take the time out to donate.
  
And all the healing thoughts you have, she&#8217;ll take them.
