First, an update on my friend &#8211; she is doing as well as we could hope, healing and recovering in the ICU at Stanford. Many ups and downs but she&#8217;s made it clear she doesn&#8217;t want to go so all we can do is send her our love and strength.
  
My knitting progress on Sherbet was pretty good until last night, but then I decided I didn&#8217;t like the increases on the sleeves (they were holey) and as a result the side didn&#8217;t look right when I stitched it up, so&#8230; rrrrriiiippp!!! My husband can&#8217;t understand how I can like a hobby where you undo your work so frequently. But I learned good stuff and didn&#8217;t waste any material. How cool is that? Tonight I&#8217;ll make a \*good\* sleeve while watching TV, and I&#8217;ll stitch that baby on and it will be good. Have to be somewhat expeditious about this since Kaily&#8217;s bday is on Saturday.
  
Here&#8217;s my SP4 list for my SP4 pal (and anyone else who might be curious):
  
 1. Are you a yarn snob (do you prefer high- and/natural fibers)? Do you avoid Red Heart and Lion Brand? Or is it all the same to you? 
  
<font color=blue>I like natural fibers, so I&#8217;m kind of a yarn snob&#8230; although I have enjoyed working with novelty yarns (for [this hat](http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/archives/2004/12/a_finished_obje.html) and [this scarf](http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/archives/2004/12/ribbon_yarn_sca.html))</font>
  
2. Do you spin? Crochet?
  
<font color=blue>While I have admired the wheely things at the yarn shop I have so far resisted their call. And the crochet needles in my possession are only for fixing dropped stitches. So far. </font>
  
3. Do you have any allergies? (smoke, pets, fibers, perfume, etc.)
  
<font color=blue>Smoke.</font>
  
4. How long have you been knitting?
  
<font color=blue>Since Thanksgiving weekend. It&#8217;s all [Michelle&#8217;s](http://fickleknitterfiend.domestigirl.com) fault.</font>
  
5. Do you have an Amazon or other online wish list?
  
<font color=blue>I [do](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/104-4923576-5665505?%5Fencoding=UTF8&id=1UYZQR4LWMTPC), but it&#8217;s not very up-to-date. </font>
  
6. What&#8217;s your favorite scent? (for candles, bath products etc.)
  
<font color=blue>My favorite smell \*ever\* is the Coconut Lime Verbeena stuff from bath and body works. I generally like vanilla and tropical scents, I&#8217;m not so much for the more &#8216;grown-up&#8217; smells (like lavender).</font>
  
7. Do you have a sweet tooth?
  
<font color=blue>Yes.</font>
  
8. What other crafts or Do-It-Yourself things do you like to do?
  
<font color=blue>I used to be super-non-crafty but recently I&#8217;ve started doing more general stuff. I&#8217;m going to spend some time gardening this year, I think. I like sewing, although I&#8217;m not very good yet.</font>
  
9. What kind of music do you like? Can your computer/stereo play MP3s? (if your buddy wants to make you a CD) 
  
<font color=blue>My PowerBook can play MP3s&#8230; my ipod can play them too </font>
  
10. What&#8217;s your favorite color? Or&#8211;do you have a color family/season/palette you prefer?
  
<font color=blue>I like bright jewel tones &#8211; alone or all smushed together.</font>
  
11. What is your family situation? Do you have any pets?
  
<font color=blue>Husband, 1. Children, 2 (Boy, 5; Girl, 7). Cats, 2. Dogs, 2. Fish, lots.</font>
  
12. What are your life dreams? (really stretching it here, I know)
  
<font color=blue>To achieve zen mastery. Be a good mom. Have fun.</font>
  
13. What is/are your favorite yarn/s to knit with?
  
<font color=blue>Haven&#8217;t been knitting long enough to really find a preference. My current project is with cotton tape and I think I might use that for a summer tank &#8211; I really like the way it looks. I&#8217;d like to make something with Noro&#8230;</font>
  
14. What fibers do you absolutely \*not\* like? 
  
<font color=blue>Acrylic. Ew.</font>
  
15. What is/are your current knitting obsession/s? 
  
<font color=blue>Socks! I have to make some for Sockapalooza!</font>
  
16. What is/are your favorite item/s to knit?
  
<font color=blue>I&#8217;ve enjoyed all of the projects I&#8217;ve made, but I am really enjoying the sweater I&#8217;m working on now&#8230; putting the pieces together into a whole &#8220;thing&#8221; is really satisfying.</font>
  
17. What are you knitting right now?
  
<font color=blue>Sherbet, due at a birthday party on Saturday.</font>
  
18. What do you think about ponchos? 
  
<font color=blue>Haven&#8217;t decided yet. I have some baby alpaca which may become a scarf someday.</font>
  
19. Do you prefer straight or circular needles?
  
<font color=blue>Depends on what I&#8217;m working on&#8230;</font>
  
20. Bamboo, aluminum, plastic?
  
<font color=blue>I like wooden needles (harder wood) and the Inox metal needles, and my Denise needles are great too. I&#8217;m not fond of the acrylic needles, even though they are fun to look at.</font>
  
21. Are you a sock knitter?
  
<font color=blue>Not right at this moment. But the deadline for Sockapalooza is March 1 so I&#8217;d better get cracking! (right after Sherbet)</font>
  
22. How did you learn to knit?
  
<font color=blue>From [Michelle](http://fickleknitterfiend.blogspot.com/).</font>
  
23. How old is your oldest UFO?
  
<font color=blue>Ha! I don&#8217;t keep UFO&#8217;s around. I rip them unceremoniously down to their elemental parts. I think I just haven&#8217;t been knitting long enough to accumulate UFOs&#8230;</font>
  
24. What is your favorite animated character or a favorite animal/bird? ??
  
<font color=blue>Uh, I like cats. I like The Tick. Aladdin is cool. Oh! I liked Elastigirl a lot from The Incredibles! Can you tell from my blog name?</font>
  
25. What is your favorite holiday?
  
<font color=blue>Thanksgiving</font>
  
26. Is there anything that you collect?
  
<font color=blue>Books&#8230; cookbooks, knitting books, science fiction books, romance books, parenting books, fitness books&#8230; well, pretty much all kinds of books.</font>
