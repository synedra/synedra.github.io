Tommy Thompson and the HAHS Singers have come out with a new hit single! Following the phenomenal apathy brought on by the 2000 nutritional guidelines (With a pyramid! How could we not be excited about that?) they have created a new cover with the same information. The 2000 nutritional guidelines could be summed up with &#8220;Psst&#8230; if it&#8217;s not too much trouble, you should probably eat less, choose better food, and exercise when it&#8217;s convenient.&#8221; Apparently that didn&#8217;t do the trick, so yesterday they came out with some new guidelines. &#8220;EAT LESS! EXERCISE MORE! DON&#8217;T EAT CRAP!&#8221; We&#8217;ll see if that has any better results&#8230; I&#8217;m doubting it. Personal responsibility never sells very well.
  
Personally, I already try to exercise 60-90 minutes most days, and I do well, nutrition wise, when I try to follow the 80/20 rule. To help keep me on track, I&#8217;m starting this blog. I&#8217;ll keep track of my eating (in a sort of 80/20 way &#8211; \*smile\*) and my activity.
  
My big &#8216;resolution&#8217; goal this year is to do the Wharf to Wharf in July, and run from beginning to end. I&#8217;ll keep my current goals and progress in the sidebar so we can all admire (or mock) my progress. Plus, I&#8217;m too lazy to officially log everything in FitDay.
  
That&#8217;s it for now. Will post later about my fabulous first day&#8230;
