Say, what color is the albatross around \*your\* neck? Mine is red!

And&#8230; it&#8217;s finished! Free at last, free at last, thank g*d almighty I&#8217;m free at last! The really funny thing is that this project wasn&#8217;t very hard or complicated or even very extensive. But I started it a week before Christmas as a Christmas present (and I&#8217;ve had lots of other intervening things on my plate) and so it&#8217;s been hanging over my head like the [sword of Damocles](http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2549/damocles.html), haunting me until I finally finished it. Today. Hit 60 inches, bound off, wove in ends, woo!
  
Didn&#8217;t get much else done today &#8211; my little girl (who is 7) has a nasty cold and I was up with her until 3 so I&#8217;m tired and cranky and have no energy.
  
Tomorrow I can get started on my next projects:

  * Washcloth in Continental knitting! I want to get this done so I am comfortable knitting continentally. I&#8217;ll use the [Knitting Help](http://www.knittinghelp.com/) videos for this, but mostly I think I just need to practice. 
      * First pair of socks for Sockapalooza for beginners (due March 1). Need yarn. Need a pattern. Need some DPNs. Other than that I&#8217;m all ready to go on this! 
          * Sweater or shoes or something for Kaily (the baby featured in the last post)&#8230; her first birthday is in February 
              * Chevron scarf in Manos Stria Cotton for my friend. This, I have everything for. 
                  * First goodie kit for my Knitty Secret Pal 3 pal&#8230; </ul> 
                    That&#8217;s probably enough for one day, I think.
  
                    Since I&#8217;m pretty certain my SP doesn&#8217;t read my blog I will mention that I found some fabulous SP-worthy stitch markers of two types &#8211; [Sushi Stitch markers](http://www.amyville.com/) and [Goddess Stitch Markers](http://www.zenknit.com/buy.html). Very cool!
  
                    In fitness and health news, I started a new [blog](http://fitness.domestigirl.com/) to journal my strides toward a healthier life. The &#8220;Be Fit&#8221; logo over there >>> no longer goes to [FitDay](http://www.fitday.com/) &#8211; it now goes to my new blog. I&#8217;m planning to run in a bunch of races this year. Stay tuned if you&#8217;re interested&#8230;
