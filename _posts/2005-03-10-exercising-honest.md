Well, I did take the weekend off, but I&#8217;ve been to martial arts every day this week. Haven&#8217;t done much running&#8230; I did run a mile on Monday before class&#8230; but I feel like I&#8217;m doing a good job of working out. I wish the kids didn&#8217;t have tomorrow off, I&#8217;d like to go down by the beach and run in the morning. But I&#8217;ll probably have to settle for another martial arts class instead ðŸ™‚
  
Upcoming race, still: Emerald Nuts Across the Bay 12K on the 20th&#8230; should be fun!
