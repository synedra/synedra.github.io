Yes, it&#8217;s true. After a 5 day trip to Disneyland and fighting a nasty intestinal bug for 4 days, I managed to **finish the socks**!
  
Like the Olsen twins, these socks are fraternal twins which look almost identical at first glance. I&#8217;m very proud of them, my first pair of socks, and I hope that my sockapalooza pal loves them despite their lateness and some inevitable flaws.

Next up, a moebius cat bed in bright red! Although I&#8217;m itching to try some more socks now that I&#8217;ve got the hang of it!
