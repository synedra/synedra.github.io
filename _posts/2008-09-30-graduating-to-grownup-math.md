I&#8217;ve now spent almost a month working on my maths with [Aleks](http://www.aleks.com/).&nbsp; We&#8217;ve gotten along famously, and I&#8217;ve gotten a handle on most of the things one might need in order to slide into harder math with relative ease.&nbsp; Congratulations, me.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve graduated!

I have a few branches I can choose from in order to further myself along the evolutionary path to &#8220;someone who can play with robots&#8221; and also &#8220;someone who can fully understand casual lunchtime conversation at work,&#8221; not to mention &#8220;someone who can solve impossible problems in 42 seconds.&#8221;&nbsp; 

I think my next steps should be Linear Algebra and The Theory of Computability.&nbsp; After that I can look again at the algorithms and machine learning books, but for now I think this is the most obvious next step.&nbsp; So, how to go about this?&nbsp; I have at my disposal many people who know these things forwards and backwards, but I still need some guidance to grasp the concepts so I don&#8217;t drive them insane and inadvertently cause my premature death.&nbsp; I could just read the textbooks but history says I won&#8217;t.

After some research, I&#8217;ve decided to take advantage of the [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm) courses, which seem to have been put out there for people like me to slurp up difficult concepts.&nbsp; At least for this, um, &#8220;semester.&#8221;&nbsp; I will take their [Linear Algebra](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/CourseHome/index.htm) class (with super cool java applets to play with!) as well as the [Theory of Computation](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-045JSpring-2005/Syllabus/index.htm).&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I&#8217;ll also sneak in some [Street Fighting Mathematics](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-098January--IAP--2008/Readings/index.htm), because that course just looks fun. I&#8217;ll keep myself honest by journaling my progress and keeping my mentor/clone apprised of how I&#8217;m doing.&nbsp; And of course you, my imaginary friends.

In my work life, I&#8217;m spending this week attempting the impossible &#8211; take some code from someone else, and make it work and sing with a tight deadline.&nbsp; So far it&#8217;s going well.&nbsp; And this morning I made it through most of a Bikram class.&nbsp; I must be getting back to something nearing normal.
