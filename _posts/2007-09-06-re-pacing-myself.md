This week I started my new job at [Applied Minds](http://www.appliedminds.com/), and I&#8217;ve been down in Glendale this week meeting people, ramping up, and brainstorming what we can do. It&#8217;s an amazing place, as you might imagine, filled with brilliant people with amazing ideas. But it&#8217;s also a workplace with things that need improving, so I&#8217;ve managed, with some help, to scrounge up a server to install Socialtext on, so that I can collaborate with my management team and some other teams can use it for their projects.
  
It&#8217;s funny, coming from a company which is all-collaboration-all-the-time to go to a company which is brilliant in so many other ways, but which hasn&#8217;t spent much time thinking through ways to reduce redundancy and build shared understanding on things. Since I&#8217;m going to be a remote worker (basically the only one they have) I&#8217;m strongly motivated to create processes and systems to make it simple for the mother ship to know what I&#8217;m working on, provide feedback and participate in collaborative activities.
  
For the first few months, I plan to come down here for about a week each month, so that I can both establish myself as a useful AMI team member in general and take advantage of the mighty brainpower assembled here. The atmosphere here is really delightful, so that&#8217;s a draw as well.
  
After Labor Day weekend, I was pretty darned tired, and I&#8217;m trying very hard to keep reminding myself that there&#8217;s no need to rush here. I&#8217;ve put together a list of things I need to explore, and I&#8217;ve set aside two weeks to explore and experiment and write up ideas, and then we&#8217;ll come back together at the end of the month to discuss the options, tune them further, and decide on an overall strategy.
  
It&#8217;s really odd to come from a company where there was a true sense of urgency (the company struggled at various times) throughout my time there, compounded by a false sense of urgency contributed by some of the management team and by myself as well due to the nature of my position. Here, I&#8217;m supposed to take my time and be deliberate. Slowing down and taking my time isn&#8217;t something I have a lot of experience with, so here&#8217;s hoping I find my way there.
  
I was happy to see that my OpenID talk was accepted at the [Pittsburgh Perl Workshop](http://pghpw.org/ppw2007/talks). Should be a lot of fun.
