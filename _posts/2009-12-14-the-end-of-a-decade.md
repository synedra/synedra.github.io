Ah, here we are in the last month of the last year of the decade. Well, technically we&#8217;re really not. We get to spend this delightful month (and the one next year) debating over which one is really &#8220;The end of a decade.&#8221; 

I know that people, in general, start counting at one. And the &#8220;first year of our calendar&#8221; was &#8220;1&#8221;, not &#8220;0&#8221;. So techincally, the decades since the start of our calendar should be considered as &#8220;1&#8230;0&#8221;, in which case we&#8217;ve got another year to go before the end of this decade. The more pedantic among us will be happy to make this argument \*every single time\* we hit &#8220;9&#8221; on the terminal year digit. And each and every time it&#8217;s a fascinating argument to endure.

However, I have a different perspective. A decade is a series of 10 years. It doesn&#8217;t have to be &#8220;the 10 years defined as 1..0&#8221;. A decade could be every 10 years that ends with a year ending in 5. And the way we refer to our decades (the 50&#8217;s, the 60&#8217;s, the 90&#8217;s) it really makes more sense to think that we&#8217;re talking about the tens digit number, not some specific mathematical distance from the beginning of the calendar.

So count it how you like. I think it&#8217;s reasonable to say that years that started with 195 were the 1950&#8217;s. I think it&#8217;s fine to celebrate the new millenium when we change 3 different numbers on the calendar, instead of the next one. Decades can be defined arbitrarily, so despite the fact that I love this debate topic \*rolls eyes\* I think we can move on to other more ground shaking discussions. You say to-may-to&#8230;
